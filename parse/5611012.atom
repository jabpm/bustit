&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;OSIS Refresh Dust Dry Shampoo (Suggested Retail Price: $23.50 Available at select salons)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

"Curly haired girls: I wish I could tell you this product could buy you an extra half hour of shut-eye. If you've got any trace of bed-head, though, a spritz of Osis Refresh Dust isn't going to "refresh" your look. It will perfume your hair, however -- with a heavy fragrance that impressively persists for hours. And it will also dry up any greasy roots, as promised -- with a super-powered shot of fine powder. (Be sure to follow the instructions; when they say spray from a distance, they're not kidding.) But your hair will in no way look as good as it does after a "wet" shampoo. In fact, mine probably looked worse. (Blasting dark hair with filmy white stuff will do that.) Unless your day includes plans to hit up a hippie drum-circle in the park, suck it up and shower. Rating: 3/5." -Leah Collins&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

"As a first time user of dry shampoo, this product exceeded my expectations.  The application method takes a bit of practice, with short spurts in a concentrated area.  I think the key is to separate hair at the roots and focus on areas that look greasy.  Be cautious of how close you are spraying, because a white spot will show if you spray too close.  I was very impressed with the amount of volume and lift that was created without any blow-drying.  Although my hair is thick, it can still use a pick me up on days that I don't shampoo.  I would also recommend this product for thin hair to create volume on any day of the week. Rating:  4.5/5. "  -Jennifer Simone&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Marc Anthony 2nd Day Clear Dry Shampoo (Suggested Retail Price: $ 11.99. Available at Shoppers Drugmart)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;


"It's an invisible spray with a barely-there scent -- and on my frizzy curls, its effects were just as undetectable. As I learned from the OSIS Refresh Dust, dry shampoo is no fun for unbrushable curls unless your coif has somehow avoided a dreaded case of bed-head. At least the OSIS left my locks perfumed. Applying the Marc Anthony spray only wasted one minute I could have been spending in the shower. Rating: 2/ 5. " -Leah Collins&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

"I'm very pleased with Marc Anthony's 2nd Day Dry Shampoo.  I've been trying to get away from washing my hair daily and instead washing every second day, which was recommended by my hair dresser. I've tried the John Frieda and found it left a white powdery finish. The Marc Anthony product goes on clear and stays clear.  It gave me volume without being drying. The smell is very light and fresh.  It's an aerosol application so it's easy to use.  For $11.99 it's worth it as its not being used every day. Rating: 4/5. " -Cynthia Benaicha&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

"With my hair as thin as it is and so incredibly flat on my head all I crave is volume. Unfortunately this clear dry shampoo was far from dry and gave no body to my hairdo. The product went on wet and did nothing but add shine. I would not use this again since I saw no difference with or without the spray and shine is unwanted on a day when I've skipped the shampoo. Rating: 0/5. " -Robyn Kelly&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

"Dry shampoo has saved my life on many occasions, so I'm constantly on the lookout for new and improved types. This version has exceeded all previous dry shampoo experiences I've had. To start with, the shampoo is clear, not a white powder like many others. It left my hair looking and feeling clean, where others leave my hair feeling heavy and sticky. It didn't have any noticeable smell, good or bad, and I was able to style my hair the exact same way that I do when it is freshly washed. I will definitely be using this again. Rating: 5/5. " -Stephanie Woods&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

"I tried the Marc Anthony 2nd Day Dry Shampoo and was happy with it overall. I've never tried a dry shampoo before so I didn't know what to expect. It went on a bit wet but didn't leave any residue in my hair and it was clear instead of white, which I think is great. I've heard that many dry shampoos look powdery and I have really dark hair so I was concerned that this would be obvious in my hair, which didn't happen. It also left my hair feeling soft. The down side to this "shampoo" was that it comes in an aerosol spray and it has a rather strong smell coming out of the can so it was a bit overpowering at first. Also, the photo on the box made it look like I would somehow end up with movie star hair with one spray … not so, but I think I would use the product again. Rating: 3/5.

&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;got2b Rockin' It Dry Shampoo Encore Fresh (Suggested Retail Price:  $6.99. Available at Shoppers Drugmart)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

"I would not recommend this product for really short, pixie style haircuts. It doesn't solve my main problem of taming unruly, spiky hair in the morning like washing my hair does. The dry shampoo is good for greasy hair, but if you already use a lot of product, it leaves you with a ton of additional buildup. It also takes ALL the shine out of your hair, leaving it flat and dull looking. The spray is really powerful; it explodes out of the can and doesn't allow for an even distribution over your head. I have black hair and the powder finish left my hair looking white/grey, so you need to brush it out thoroughly!  In the time spent spraying and brushing out the product, it would have been faster to wash/wet my hair and give it a quick blowdry. Rating: 0/5. " -Bonnie Large&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

"This product was easy to use and smells amazing.  I noticed the spray has to be shaken well before use, otherwise it doesn't spray evenly.  I divided my hair into sections and applied it to back of my head first and then the front.  Then I used my fingers to massage the product in to my hair and styled it.  Surprisingly, it didn't make my fingers sticky at all. I am addicted to this product and already recommended it to my friends and family. Rating: 5/5. " -Katie Jadidi&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

" My alarm clock and I have never really gotten along. In the morning the last thing I want to do is wash and blow-dry my head upside down. Got2b Rockin' It Dry Shampoo gave me a break and had me off to work with a style in no time.  This product goes on dry and is not sticky to touch. Works well and doesn't leave a lot of build-up on the hair. I have been using this at least once a week now and love the result. Rating 5/5. " -Robyn Kelly&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

"Dry shampoo has got to be one of my favourite hair products. It has definitely been my life saver countless times as I tend to have fairly greasy hair on the second day after a wash.  First step for the got2b Dry Shampoo is to shake well before spraying. This sprays on like a hair spray would, but is fairly powerful and should be sprayed in short bursts. The spray comes out white and somewhat powdery, which I have grown accustomed to having used dry shampoo for awhile now. Luckily, I have blonde hair, so this isn't too much of an issue for me. I also blow dry my hair after spraying, which helps to soak up the colour and set the spray as well. Overall, it's a pretty easy product to use, considering all you do is spray your roots. In the end, this product does its job. My hair gains some volume, as well as a freshly washed look, which lasts for the majority of the day. However, the major downside to this product is the smell. I absolutely hate having my hair smell like some kind of cleaning product, which is what this reminds me of. Still, For the price I can't really complain too much as most dry shampoos are at least double the price. Rating: 3.5/5. " -Kim D'Amato&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;John Frieda Luxurious Volume Anytime Volume Refresher (Suggested Retail Price: $ 10.49 available at grocery stores, drugstores and other mass market retailers)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

"I think I may have found my new dry shampoo. This is one of the first I have found that does not turn your hair white, which is amazing. As for all dry shampoos, this must be shaken well prior to use. This sprays on in short, full, powerful bursts, which covers my hair nicely. It also adds much needed volume to my very thin hair, which is an added bonus. Normally I would need to brush out my hair after using dry shampoo, but it really wasn't needed this time, which makes this product great for quick use. Even the smell wasn't awful and really only lasted a few minutes after being sprayed on. The only major downside of this product is that the can is fairly small and in the mid-price range. I would definitely splurge on this one though and recommend it to anyone. Rating: 4.5/5. " -Kim D'Amato&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

"This dry shampoo smells nice and works relatively well.  I tried this after the OSIS product, which I think is hard to top.  The difference between the two is the amount of lift created.  Although John Frieda's dry shampoo eliminated that greasy look, it didn't provide half the amount of lift that OSIS did.  For a cheaper option I still think it is worth buying, but I would try it with a quick blow dry next time to activate its volume boosting capabilities. Rating: 3.5/5 " -Jennifer Simone&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
