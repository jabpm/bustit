And while developer Epic Games struggled to draw the player's attention to the narrative in the first two Gears games, with Gears of War 3 they've finally found a good balance of story building and chainsawing.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Part of the way they get you to invest in the story is by twisting a knife in your the heart. Gears has always been about themes of loss mirrored within a crumbling war-torn landscape, and Gears 3 takes this to the next level. It almost seems as if the team at Epic is taunting critics who said their “dudebro” game could never elicit an emotional response. I'd be more specific if it didn't mean spoiling a huge chunk of the story, but there is a good chance your “allergies will be acting up” in a scene or two. Of course, in the end, you are still shooting sci-fi guns at giant bees and armoured cats, so emotional investment can only go so far.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you do end up completely ignoring the story, the rest of the game stands as one of the best third-person shooters, well, ever. The first Gears basically defined mainstream game design for this generation of consoles, and playing Gears 3 is a stark reminder many other companies are simply aping Gears tropes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For the uninitiated, in Gears you control soldier Marcus Fenix, his brother-in-arms Dominic Santiago or one of several side characters depending on the level and the number of people you're playing the game with (the whole game is playable cooperatively with up to four players). Your main weapon is the lancer rifle, which is a big gun with a chainsaw built into the end, and you progress through the game by dashing from cover point to cover point while returning fire at various monstrous enemies.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;One of the main reasons the game works so well is that the level of polish on the game is phenomenal. Little things — such as the way your gun sounds as it runs low on bullets, or how the grisly gibs fly out of a chainsawed enemy or the satisfying thump from firing a shotgun — add up a game that is always immersing you, pulling you into the moment of combat and keeping your heartbeat racing.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Another reason your heart gets racing is because the combat encounters are designed to perfection. Enemies are arranged in such a way that there is a tension between tactical options at your disposal: Do you press forward or hang back? Keep the enemy suppresed or move around to flank? Go for the power weapon or keep what you have? These choices were available in previous Gears games, but in Gears 3, it feels like Epic has finally gotten the formula just right. This is mixed with an changing set of game styles; just when the standard flank and cover mechanics are starting to get tired, the game throws you on the back of a truck or strapped to the bottom of a living blimp for variety.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;One of the ways that Gears 3 separates itself from its predecessors is through its truly varied environments. The joke in Gears 1 was that the world could be any colour as long as it was brown. While Gears 2 partially alleviated this, Gears 3 truly bursts into colour with several very different environments that look completely different from one another. The fact that this burst of rainbow does not hamper the series' signature look of crumbling decadence, but enhances it, is another way Epic's Gears team outdid themselves.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;And despite incorporating four player co-op for the first time, Gears 3 is the first game in the series that really feels like it still plays fairly well with just one. That said, adding additional players in does add to the game a lot, as communication and teamwork are essential, especially at higher difficulty levels.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;On the negative side, nothing in Gears 3 is going to win over those put off by its gruesome, if slightly over-the-top violence, which is still in full force. One of the core rewards in the Gears games is the satisfying feeling of dispatching an enemy that would normally take a full clip of bullets with single up close swing of the chainsaw, and if that disturbs you, you will have trouble enjoying Gears 3. Additionally, everyone on the planet of Sera (where Gears is set) still looks like a linebacker on steroids, another thing that's put people off of the series. That doesn't change here either.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Muliplayer-wise, the Gears experience feels like its finally getting as robust as the similar suites in Call of Duty or Halo. There are with several different, well balanced competitive modes and more fleshed out cooperative challenge modes with an upgraded Horde mode and the new Beast mode. As with any multiplayer-mode, it will take weeks and months to see if a reliable community emerges and if there aren't any game breaking exploits for jerks to ruin everyone's fun with.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Overall, Gears 3 stands out as one of the best shooters so far this year in first or third person. Alongside the (much different) Portal 2, it is an early game-of-the-year contender. If you've been hesitant about Gears before, this is a great place to start. If you've played the first two games to death, this is a satisfying conclusion.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Oh, and when you beat the game, stick around through the credits for an amazing(ly awful) ICE-T song about playing Gears of War.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Gears of War 3 comes out Tuesday, September 20, exclusively for the Xbox 360. Another review of Gears of War 3 from Andrea Ball will look at the game from a more casual perspective.
