What wasn't retro was the viral video campaign used to bring the fashion phenomenon back to a brand new crowd of 18 to 24-year-old fashionistas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rugged, yet fashionable, tan pillow boot with the redfelt-lined tongue was at the centre of the Cougar brand's success, when the brothers' father and uncle established it in the mid-1970s, Steve Sedlbauer says. "In 1981, that boot made us the biggest manufacturer of footwear in Canada."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a bankruptcy of the manufacturing arm and a restructuring in the 1990s, the brothers took the Cougar name and started anew, outsourcing manufacturing and introducing new designs. Two years ago, they hit a plateau, Mr. Sedlbauer says. "We knew we needed to examine our marketing, our business and our brand to continue to grow."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research showed Baby Boomers carried fond memories of the original pillow boot. But how could Cougar duplicate the buzz that captured the hearts of teens and young adults back then?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was the same challenge the original owners had 30 years ago. It was mostly younger women who wore them back then. Now we had to find a way to appeal to the same demographic," says Andrew Simon, partner and chief creative officer for Cougar's ad agency BlammoWorldwide in Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We wanted to reach a very specific, hard to target demographic that had not heard of Cougar and had no pre-conceived perception of the brand," Mr. Sedlbauer says. "Online is where those people want to talk to you, so that's where we focused our entire efforts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They hatched a plan to run a contest asking Canadians what crazy thing they would do to win a limited edition boot and then capture the winners in the act on video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it would be easy to do just any social networking play on the budget, the campaign also needed to be effective and talk to a very qualified audience in a fresh way, Mr. Simon says. "Social media is where everything is driven these days. That was where the contest entries needed to happen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given this was a fashion play, the key was to find the social media venue that mattered to young trendsetters. The decision to run the campaign in partnership with Livedress.com made strategic sense, since the site boasts more than 200,000 younger followers a love of what's new in fashion in common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's all about fun and getting people involved. People love fashion," says Jonathan Davids, Livedress.com founder, about getting a fashion brand into the younger mindset. "We thought, let's just ask our followers what crazy things they would do to win a pair of boots, pick our favourites, show up at the door with a camera crew, and make them do it. It had to be spontaneous for it to work."&lt;/p&gt;</div><div id="2">&lt;p&gt;Livedress.com managed the full scope of the project, from selecting winners and co-ordinating surprise visits to winners with a camera crew, to production and distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The call for "How Far Would You Go For a Great Pair of Boots" contest reached thousands of qualified followers, garnering hundreds of official entries. And the ripple effect continues. Each wining video has drawn more than 30,000 views to date. "Cougar also had a bump in its organic search results, leading to even more visits to its site," Mr. Davids says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Facebook and Twitter target mass markets, there's a huge opportunity in building niche networks that target special interest groups such as younger fashion lovers, he says. "In today's segmented world it doesn't help you to reach 20 million people that have absolutely nothing in common."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The campaign took four months to execute, and cost less than $100,000. "That's a very efficient way to get this kind of reach," he says. "A traditional broadcast campaign would have cost four times as much. With this approach, you can go a lot further for a lot less money because it reaches a lot of the right people very quickly in a very familiar way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the trick to Cougar's viral maketing campaign was to not make it about selling the boots, Mr. Sedlbauer says. "It was about engaging pop culture and generating excitement at the retail level."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while 2011/12 sales are yet to be tallied, "We know the retailers are ordering them and the boots are selling. Next winter is when we'll see the real results of our efforts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;entrepreneur@nationalpost.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VIRAL VIDEO BASICS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viral video has become the most popular advertising service for Livedress.com's social networking site, says founder Jonathan Davids. Here are some basics every business should consider in planning a campaign:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Define your audience. Then find the best social media channels to reach them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use real people and make it spontaneous. Viewers like to connect with the person on camera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep it short. Three to five minutes is ideal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep it real. Don't fall into the infomercial trap by inserting logos or product endorsements. The content has to come across as organic and worth sharing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Build a story so the video will hold its own as editorial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't go cheap on production value. While it's not necessary to go high end, invest in professional production and editing so you have something people enjoy watching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Include a call to action taking viewers back to your website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is often overlooked. It could be anything from embedding QR codes in videos or clicking to win a shopping spree, to visiting the website to register for a newsletter, or offering rewards for sharing the video.
