One. And suddenly, Pitchfork's profiling you, Perez Hilton has his all-caps-addicted minions tracking you down - and the sudden attention is enough to make you want to &amp;quot;spontaneously gag.&amp;quot;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For New York duo Cults, that one song was Go Outside. First released online in early 2010, it's sweet like the twinkles of glockenspiel that hammer out its Brill Building-worthy melody, and yet ever so slightly sinister, thanks to a swath of reverb. It's also the first song the band's Madeline Follin and Brian Oblivion ever wrote together.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It reportedly took them about an hour to finish. (Diversions from college homework should only be so time-consuming, I suppose.)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When it was done, they posted it online - which led to a re-post by tastemaker blog Gorilla vs. Bear, which led to more buzz from Pitchfork, and Perez, etc. - buzz that begat a major-label record deal (with Sony) and their self-titled album this June.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Then, there's the international touring, which won't relent this fall when they travel North America with Foster the People. (They reach Toronto Oct. 1 and Vancouver Oct. 10.) Moreover, there are all the other weird extras that have followed all this business: a run-in with Susan Boyle, quitting school, music videos starring Emma Roberts and Dave Franco and becoming Facebook friends with girl-group idols like the Shangri-Las' Mary Weiss.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;But first, the band's Brian Oblivion (real name Ryan Mattos) shares his own take on what Go Outside meant for him and bandmate/girlfriend Follin - and talks about what the band has planned for the future, including a new album.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Q: I know it's been a long time since Go Outside, the song on the playlist, came out, but it's been such a significant one for you. Have you ever wondered what you'd be doing - or what would have happened if you'd never written that song?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Brian Oblivion: Oh man, music was never either Madeline or my plan for our lives, you know. We've been making music in kind of weird ways since we were teenagers, but if we hadn't put that song out and gotten that reaction from people, we probably wouldn't have ever kept doing it. It was really just something we put together just out of fun - and boredom. And a desire to do something that wasn't rigid, like all of our art-school projects. So, yeah, without that song, I probably wouldn't do anything with music. I'd probably be graduated by now, and desperately looking for a job like everyone else I know.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Q:: What was your reaction when it first started taking off?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Oblivion: Madeline and I both developed a habit around that time of spontaneously gagging that we haven't been able to kick ever since. Like, right before a show, or whenever we've got to do something important, we'll just start throwing up. (Laughs) I don't know why. It's just nerves, you know. This is just a very nerve-racking profession. Like, every night. When you're a band, just every show matters, everything you do is important when you're new. It's just scary. You want to do your best all the time - so you just throw up.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Q: Just hearing Go Outside being played: Was that ever one of those scary moments?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Oblivion: We've been hearing it. (Laughs.) It's not necessarily scary, but it's happened to us, like, four or five times on the last tour, where we'd walk into a restaurant in a new city and the bartender or the waiter or whatever will put on our album, or whatever, and think that's a funny thing to do. But it's the last thing you want to listen to when you're on tour. . . . Everyone at the bar is kinda smiling at you like, 'Cool, right?' And you're like 'No-oo-o. Not cool.' (Laughs.)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Q: I'm under the impression Go Outside is also the first song you ever wrote together.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Oblivion: It is, yeah.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Q: So I'm wondering: How has your songwriting changed since then?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Oblivion: I think we've become a lot more obviously skilled (as) songwriters. I don't know; it remains to be seen whether that'll be something people want or not, because so much of what the first record was, was just enthusiasm. We were feeling it, you can hear it when you hear the songs; they sound like the first songs people have written. And a lot of my favourite records are like that, you know. It's not over-calculated or anything. I don't know if we'll be able to avoid that overblown 90-person symphony sophomore record. (Laughs.) That would be the nightmare.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Q: When do you figure you'll start working on that sophomore record?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Oblivion: Well, for the first time ever, for this next tour, we got a bus - which is, like, the coolest thing that's ever happened to me. So we're going to set up a studio in the back and have tons of time to work on everything. It feels good. We got to write new music recently, which was amazing. You forget how much fun that is after awhile, because you get so bogged down with touring.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I feel like I've been working on a few different records. It remains to be seen whether one cannibalizes the other - or if they end up working side by side. When I first started this band with Madeline, I had never really played guitar. I had always played the bass in bands. So now, I'm a lot better at guitar, so I'd wanted to make a guitar record. But now, on the other hand, a lot of the new songs we're writing are super-electronic and don't have any guitar parts at all. We'll have to find some weird middle ground between the two.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Q: What's happening with the hip-hop mixtape project you first talked about this spring?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Oblivion: Yeah, the first song should be coming out first thing next month, or this month. We did a track with a rapper named Freddie Gibbs, who's really awesome, and I'm super-excited about that. That's like my little reward from the record label that they're letting me do it. (Laughs.) &amp;quot;Well, you do this tour and you did well, so we'll let you do some rap remixes.&amp;quot; It's a remix of the song Bad Things from our record. . . .That's kind of the goal for the rest of the year, just to squeeze in time to put out as much weird, challenging art as we can. Because it's - it's really hard to think about how some bands just tour on the same record for two years and never put out anything.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Q: Will there be a full record of remixes?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Oblivion: I think that'll probably be like an EP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Q: Who are you working with next, then?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Oblivion: Oh jeez. I got in trouble recently for saying stuff about which people we were working with, and then we got their price quotes back, and so I don't want to say anything before it's actually done.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Q: So these aren't best friends of yours whom you can ask to do it for free, then?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Oblivion: Oh no. And rappers are notoriously flaky and expensive, so that's a challenge. (Laughs.) We'll get there.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Q: Who are you hoping to get?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Oblivion: Stuff by The-Dream, probably. MF Doom and like, Lil B. I dunno. Curren$y maybe, that seems possible. But once again, we'll see.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Q: When do you want to have it out?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Oblivion: Christmas probably, because I feel nobody puts anything out around Christmas. No credible bands, so you might as well put out something. It'll be something weird and entertaining around Christmas, just to keep everybody from dying of Susan Boyle boredom.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Q: Hey, wait a sec. I thought you met her.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Oblivion: Yeah. OK. She's alright.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Q: What's the connection between this hip-hop project and the Brill Building sound you currently work with?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Oblivion: Well, I somehow feel tied to it, because a lot of my favourite hip-hop producers, like Mad Lib and the RZA, a lot of that music is what they're sampling and turning into something else. I think both Madeline and I want to write songs for other bands - and we already do tons of collaborations. I think that interactive aspect of the music scene has been kind of downplayed, or, like, it's not thought of as cool anymore. But I think it can be awesome. Even if you're a band, you can have someone else write a song for you and it'll be really amazing. That's how it all used to go. I dunno. We're trying to play to our community.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</div></content><rights type="text">Copyright (c) dose.ca</rights><source><title type="html">Cults won't forget their first</title><subtitle type="html">Their very first song changed their lives forever.
