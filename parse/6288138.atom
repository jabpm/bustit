Tucked away from the casino strip on an unassuming street corner, The Gold &amp;amp; Silver Pawn Shop looks small and austere, if not a little shopworn. A modest sign declares, &amp;quot;We will buy your gold and silver,&amp;quot; while another states, &amp;quot;Open 24 hours.&amp;quot; The only hint at the surprising truth is a retro-looking red and white placard that simply reads, &amp;quot;As seen on TV.&amp;quot;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;What it could say is, &amp;quot;As seen on TV in more than 150 countries and 30 different languages.&amp;quot;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Gold &amp;amp; Silver is the home of Pawn Stars, the hit reality show returning to History Television on March 13 for an all-new season. The store is also a star-maker, turning its eccentric, argumentative operators (three generations of the Harrison family) and their endearing, dim-witted employee, Chumlee, into icons. TV Guide once aptly described the show as Antiques Roadshow with &amp;quot;a pinch of LA Ink and a dash of COPS.&amp;quot;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Before the show launched in 2009, the store saw an average of 50 customers a day. Today, they average 3,500 to 4,000.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;quot;Most people don't (realize) how long pawn shops have been out there,&amp;quot; co-owner Rick Harrison said in a November interview at a Las Vegas hotel. &amp;quot;Pawn shops were mentioned in the Bible. The Mesopotamians had pawn shops. . . . The Greeks, (and) the Romans did.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;quot;I think it's the third (oldest profession),&amp;quot; he adds with a belly laugh. &amp;quot;There is the first, and we all know what that is. Then there was gambling . . . and then there were pawn shops to pay for the first two.&amp;quot;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With Pawn Stars being one of the top-rated reality shows on cable TV, and its recent renewal for four more seasons, Rick is certainly a happy man. He was initially only hoping for a season or two, to &amp;quot;maybe help out business a bit.&amp;quot;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Gold &amp;amp; Silver's staff buy or pawn roughly 1,000 items a week. A pawn is when a customer exchanges an item for a secured loan. If the money is not returned in a set amount of time, said item belongs to the store. But only the most novel objects make their way to TV, where the family - and a handful of re-appearing outside experts - evaluate an item's authenticity and value, then try to cut a deal.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;quot;One theory I have (for our popularity) is that it's the only game show on prime-time TV,&amp;quot; Rick said. &amp;quot;It's like a game show. Literally, you walk in and, if (your item) is real, you've won the first round. And the second round is how much money you get for it, (and whether) a deal gets made.&amp;quot;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Some customers study the Harrisons' TV tactics before entering their arena, to learn their strengths and weaknesses. &amp;quot;They try,&amp;quot; Rick admitted. &amp;quot;But there is a golden rule: Whoever has the gold makes the rules. I like to think I can negotiate (well). If the deal is not right, I just don't make it.&amp;quot;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The walls and shelves of the jam-packed store are lined with the results of the Harrisons' deals. Original paintings by Picasso and Dali hang near a samurai sword from 1490 and an 1861 Civil War rifle. A rack of Rolex watches stands near a case of antique coins, and one prominent display houses varied World Series, NBA and Super Bowl rings. (One employee calls their presence the likely result of &amp;quot;one too many divorces, or one too many rehabs.&amp;quot;)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The clearest sign this is no regular pawn store is the gift shop. How many pawn owners and employees have their own bobblehead dolls? Puzzles, magnets and T-shirts are also for sale featuring the mugs of the Harrison family and Chumlee.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Rick is an affable, stocky, bulldog of man with a shaved head. At first glance, he seems better suited for the top of a Harley than a library. But with Rick, just like his shop, appearances are deceiving. He started Gold &amp;amp; Silver in 1988 with his father Richard, but his legendary historical expertise was shaped at an early age. Often bedridden as a child with epileptic fits, Rick became an avid reader.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;quot;You can't learn it all,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;As long as it's interesting, I love to read about it. But most of the things I find interesting, other people don't,&amp;quot; he noted, citing recent books on the history of financial systems and the history of mercury poisoning.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It is Rick's encyclopedic knowledge that allows him to spot the real treasures as they're brought in the door, a feat akin to finding needle in a haystack.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Since the show launched in 2009, the store has gone from eight employees to 50, and added a 10,000-foot expansion for storage. The pawnshop has as many as 12,000 items in storage at any given time. Pawn Stars' success has also spawned a wealth of TV imitators, from Auction Kings to Hardcore Pawn.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Rick is especially proud of what it has done to improve the reputation of his industry, which has long been beset by image problems, and hasn't exactly been helped by seedy pawnshop portrayals in pop culture.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;quot;We are really regulated. Whenever I buy something, I have to take their ID, their height, their weight . . . everything,&amp;quot; Rick said. &amp;quot;I turn it in to the police department and the FBI.&amp;quot;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Any serial numbers or identifiers on items are also submitted to the authorities, said Rick's son Corey, the store's day-to-day manager of operations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;quot;If you bring something stolen to a pawnshop, you're going to get caught,&amp;quot; said Corey. &amp;quot;It's quite possibly one of the stupidest things you can do with this stuff.&amp;quot;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;While Corey and Rick are capable, they still have to occasionally defer to the family patriarch. At 71, Richard &amp;quot;The Old Man&amp;quot; Harrison is an unlikely reality star. But with his signature wide-brimmed hats and crusty demeanour, he's a defining presence at the pawnshop.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;quot;He loves it. The blue hairs absolutely love him,&amp;quot; Rick said. &amp;quot;He really is that wonderful, crotchety old man. Literally, if I come in in the morning, and he's not complaining about something, I'll ask him, 'Are you feeling all right?' That's what you get. He was in the navy for 20 years; he's just an old-school guy.&amp;quot;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For the most part, it's business as usual at the store. Producers only bring in the cameras for interesting items, typically, three or four times a day. Each item takes about 30 minutes to shoot with the Harrisons, and then the shop reopens for its 24-hour business cycle.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Corey sees the shop as a sort of service. &amp;quot;Everybody has that thing in their house that grandma left them, or their parents left them, and they don't really like it; they don't want to do anything with it, they don't have a use for it. But for some reason, they think it might be worth some kind of money, and everyone is kind of curious. My show gives people an idea of what that stuff might be worth.&amp;quot;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Working at the shop since the age of nine, Corey has developed a keen sense for cheats and fakes. He has also watched the pawn business change during the economic recession.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;quot;You see a lot of guys pawning off the big toys that they bought (before the crisis). Here in Vegas . . . everyone went out and refinanced their house - all these guys got a hundred grand. And what's the first thing a guy does when he gets a hundred grand? He goes out and buys some big toy. Right now, I can't sell a Harley to save my life; I just store them. It seems like every guy is . . . now trying to sell his bike, (and) the same thing with boats and things like that.&amp;quot;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Rick admits he doesn't even watch his own show. &amp;quot;I try to get a minute or two into it, and then turn it off. It just weirds me out to see me on television. I'll sit there and say, 'God damn . . . I should have explained it like this.' I nitpick myself to death.&amp;quot;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As for keeping the series fresh for many more seasons, the Harrisons are not worried.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;quot;That's the beautiful thing about my show: There are abillion weird things out there,&amp;quot; Rick said. &amp;quot;That's the reason why it has such great legs. It's not like a motorcycle show, where there is a motorcycle every week, or a car show, where there is a car every week. . . . It's completely different every week.&amp;quot;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A HREF="mailto:clackner@postmedia.com" TARGET="_blank"&gt;clackner@postmedia.com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Pawn Star's new season bows on History Television on March 13 at 9 ET/PT.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</div></content><rights type="text">Copyright (c) Postmedia News</rights><source><title type="html">Only a pawn in their game</title><subtitle type="html">Pawn Stars returns for more wheeling and dealing.</subtitle><id>tag:www.dose.ca:content=6288138</id><rights type="html">Copyright (c) Postmedia News</rights><updated>2012-03-12T15:02:08Z</updated><category term="Pawn Stars" label="ConTopic" /><category term="Postmedia News" label="Distributor" /><category term="STRY" label="ContentTypeCode" /><category term="CAN" label="Catalog" /><category term="Y" label="Comments" /><category term="UTF8" label="Format" /><category relevance="22" term="Dali" label="City" /><category relevance="53" term="Las Vegas" label="City" /><category relevance="25" term="TV Guide" label="Company" /><category relevance="27" term="North America" label="Continent" /><category relevance="79" term="Harrison , Rick" label="Individual" /><category relevance="22" term="Kings , Auction" label="Individual" /><category relevance="22" term="Picasso , Pablo" label="Individual" /><category relevance="63" term="Stars , Pawn" label="Individual" /><category relevance="100" term="207~Rick Harrison~Pawn Stars~Las Vegas~North America" label="InformQString" /><category relevance="24" term="Antiques Roadshow" label="Misc" /><category relevance="21" term="Hardcore Pawn" label="Misc" /><category relevance="24" term="LA Ink" label="Misc" /><category relevance="21" term="Federal Bureau of Investigation" label="Organization" /><category relevance="21" term="National Basketball Association" label="Organization" /><category relevance="22" term="Auction Kings" label="Person" /><category relevance="22" term="Pablo Picasso" label="Person" /><category relevance="63" term="Pawn Stars" label="Person" /><category relevance="79" term="Rick Harrison" label="Person" /><category relevance="21" term="Rolex Watches" label="Product" /><category relevance="30" term="Arts, Entertainment, and Media" label="Topic" /><category relevance="30" term="Entertainment" label="Topic" /><category relevance="30" term="Media" label="Topic" /><category relevance="30" term="Reality Shows" label="Topic" /><category relevance="30" term="Television" label="Topic" /><generator>(c) Postmedia Network Inc.</generator><link href="http://www.dose.ca/6288138.ATOM" rel="alternate" type="application/atom+xml" title="Only a pawn in their game" /><link href="http://www.dose.ca/6288138.ATOM" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" title="Only a pawn in their game" /></source></entry><entry Status="FREE"><id>tag:www.dose.ca:content=6279805</id><title type="html">Three generations of Harrisons, Rick, Richard “The Old Man” and Corey, with employee Chumlee, in back, run The Gold &amp; Silver Pawn shop on TV’s Pawn Stars.</title><summary type="html"></summary><published>2012-03-09T00:00:00Z</published><updated>2012-03-10T00:11:30Z</updated><author><name /></author><link href="6279805.bin" Abstract="Three generations of Harrisons, Rick, Richard &amp;#8220;The Old Man&amp;#8221; and Corey, with employee Chumlee, in back, run The Gold &amp; Silver Pawn shop on TV&amp;#8217;s Pawn Stars."
