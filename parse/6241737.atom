Why else would Mariah Carey have Tweeted a &lt;A HREF="http://www.dose.ca/Nick+Cannon+hospital+with+mild+kidney+failure/5951132/story.html" TARGET="_blank"&gt;photo of herself sans makeup&lt;/A&gt;? (You'll remember the one; earlier this year, the diva shared a photo of her and husband Nick Cannon curled up in a hospital bed.)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As for what brought Cannon, 31, to hospital in January, the &lt;I&gt;America's Got Talent&lt;/I&gt; host was initially vague about the emergency, saying at the time he had suffered a &amp;quot;mild kidney failure.&amp;quot; Today, though -- after suffering subsequent health woes, including a hospitalization for blood clots in his lungs -- the young father is speaking more plainly about his medical problems.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As Cannon told &lt;A HREF="http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20575275,00.html" TARGET="_blank"&gt;&lt;I&gt;People&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/A&gt;, he has been diagnosed with an auto-immune disorder similar to Lupus. He explained to the magazine, it's &amp;quot;something I'm going to be living with all my life.&amp;quot;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In February, Cannon withdrew from his New York-based radio show because of his health. And in making the announcement, the entertainer revealed that doctors had recently discovered two &lt;A HREF="http://www.dose.ca/Nick+Cannon+Suffers+Another+Health+Scare+With+Blood+Clots+Lungs/6169880/story.html" TARGET="_blank"&gt;blood clots&lt;/A&gt; in his lungs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Speaking about the incident now, Cannon told &lt;I&gt;People&lt;/I&gt;: &amp;quot;The blood clot thing was probably the scariest because ... I've known people who have passed away from that,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;I thought I was getting better,&amp;quot; he continued, &amp;quot;and then that happened, so that kind of came out of nowhere.&amp;quot;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Cannon says that his health is &amp;quot;all in order now,&amp;quot; and he's putting a focus on treating himself with more care, taking on fewer assignments and making sure to get at least six hours of sleep a night.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;quot;I feel blessed to be alive,&amp;quot; Cannon said. &amp;quot;If it wasn't discovered, I don't know [what would have happened].&amp;quot; &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When Cannon stepped away from his aforementioned New York radio show &lt;I&gt;Rollin' with Nick Cannon&lt;/I&gt; in mid-February, the host made a statement explaining that he was doing so &amp;quot;under doctor's orders.&amp;quot;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;quot;I have been asked to put my health first and cut back on some of my professional commitments in order to allow my body to get the rest that it needs to keep up with the demands of my multi-tasking schedule,&amp;quot; he said in a statement. He continues to host a syndicated radio show, &lt;I&gt;Cannon's Countdown&lt;/I&gt;, and appears on NBC sitcom &lt;I&gt;Up All Night&lt;/I&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Cannon and Carey are parents to nine-month old twins, Moroccan and Monroe. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A HREF="mailto:leahc@dose.ca" TARGET="_blank"&gt;leahc@dose.ca&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</div></content><rights type="text">Copyright (c) dose.ca</rights><source><title type="html">What's Wrong with Nick Cannon?
