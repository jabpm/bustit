&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Lancôme Face Self Tanner: (Suggested retail price: $38.00; Available at department stores and Shoppers Drugmart)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

“I am all about being GTL (a la Jersey Shore) so I jumped at the chance to review sunless self tanners. I also jumped at the chance to review Lancôme because when I hear that name, I think luxury! For a product you apply to your face, the texture of this one didn’t disappoint. It is a light, silky smooth gel and you only need a little dab on your fingertip – three dabs in total for your entire face should do it.  The formula is non-greasy, it didn’t streak, and it gave me a radiant, natural glow. It did take a while to see the results, though. I wasn’t too fond of the smell but I liked that it did not stain my fingers. Rating: 4/5.” -Yvonne Yip&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

"This is a very gentle/gradual gel face tanner.  It took me three applications before I achieved my desired colour, which was good because when it comes to my face I would prefer it to tan gradually so it’s not too obvious.  It didn’t clog my pores and went on really light with no streaks.  It was also fast drying so you could easily apply makeup over top of it.  This one barely left anything on my hands after applying it which was great, too.  It didn’t last long, so if you want to maintain it you would have to reapply every other day.  This one is a little pricey but a little goes a long way so a bottle should last a long time.  Rating: 4.5/5." -Catherine Gibson&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
 
"The Lancome facial tanner was a pleasant switch from the heavier self tanners that I had been testing. Unfortunately, I didn't notice that much of a difference in colour. While the product wasn't greasy I did find that it made my skin look a bit like an oil slick -- shiny and a little gross. Rating: 2.5/5 -Miranda Furtado&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;


&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;br clear="all"&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dose.ca/celebrity/4539274.bin" align="left"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Kiehl's Sun Free Self Tanning Formula:  (Suggested retail price: $22.50; Available at Kiehl's locations)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;


“I’ve tried sunless tanners before but it’s tricky on my skin because I am so very, very pale (think Julianne Moore meets Casper), so getting a natural-looking glow is next to impossible. I was extra skeptical about this product, since it’s a one-size-fits-all solution (unlike others that come in light, medium or dark shades). But to my surprise, I loved the Kiehl’s! The colour goes on very gradually, so I was able to achieve a nice, light glow without every straying into Snooki territory. It also gets extra points for its texture (it’s a thick, non-streaking lotion) and its lack of scent. Rating: 5/5” – Jen McDonnell&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

“I really enjoyed the Kiehl’s tanner. It turned my skin a nice, light colour which deepened as I put it on. I didn’t turn orange at all, and it had a light scent. The only thing I didn’t like was that it was white, so it was hard to tell if I was applying it evenly. Rating: 4/5” -Jenna Downing&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

“Kiehl’s is a trusted brand for me and this was my favourite product I tested. Milkier and creamier in texture than the Lancome, it felt heavier and richer when applying to my face. This product gave me the most noticeable results and worked the fastest. I liked the fact that it contained Apricot Kernel Oil, Cocoa Seed Butter and Vitamin E so it also worked as a moisturizer. It did not have any smell though it may stain your fingers when applying so, like the bottle explains; wash your hands after using it. Rating: 4.5/5” -Yvonne Yip&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

“I loved the Kiehl's self-tanner! The smell wasn't great, but it was definitely bearable and went away with a short amount of time. It left me bronzed and beautiful with a nice golden shade and no hints of orange. I found that the light formula was really easy to apply -- I almost forgot that it was a self tanner and not just a moisturizer. Rating: 4.5/5 -Miranda Furtado&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;


&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Hard Candy Glow All the Way Instant Bronzer (Suggested retail price: under $10; Available at Wal-Mart)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

“When they say instant, they mean instant. It does give you a sparkly glow afterwards so you wouldn’t want to put it on your face, but it is great for your arms and legs.  I didn’t find it streaky but it did leave my hands a mess. I made the mistake of rubbing it into my hands first like cream and then applying it, which was a bad move on my part because my hands looked like bronzed baby boots. On the plus side, it had no odor and it lasted for three days or so.  Rating: 4/5” -Catherine Gibson&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; 
  
“The Hard Candy lotion didn’t have a very please odour – it smelled kind of like metal. It’s really nice to use on your legs, but much too shimmery for your whole body. Rating: 3/5” -Jenna Downing&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

“If you want shiny, tanned legs like Jennifer Aniston’s, this is the magic formula to achieve them! This thick cream may seem like a pain to apply but it's definitely worth it in the end. Immediately, you see deep brown results and because it's easy to see, it's easy to avoid any streaks or missing any areas. Be forewarned though, this baby comes with sparkle -- which is great if you're going out at night. I would avoid putting this on your face unless you're aiming to look like Edward Cullen. Rating 4.5/5” –Miranda Furtado&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;True Blue Spray Tanner (Suggested retail price: $16.00; Available at Bath &amp; Body Works)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

“Yuck! I liked the idea of the spray tanner because I thought it would be a great way to do your entire body (including your back) easily.  The concept is great but the result looks CHEAP!  I wasn’t sure if this one was going to stain everything in my bathroom when spraying so I stood in my bathtub to apply it.  It went on easy and thankfully didn’t leave a mess but what it did leave was a stench!  This product has some serious perfume that stunk up my entire house for the night and made it unbearable to go in the bathroom.  The scent was way too strong for my liking and because of that I would never use it again.  It also took a long time to dry and left me looking orange within a couple of hours.  The next day the orange colour started to fade, but I got a rash from it and was itching all over.  I do have very sensitive skin, though.  The concept and price point are great but the product needs work. Rating: 2/5. -Catherine Gibson&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Xen-Tan (Suggested retail price: $56.00; Available at xen-tan.com)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

“I tried Xen-Tan on my legs only. I found the cream extremely thick, which made it really hard to apply evenly. I felt like I was putting a clay mask on my legs! I had to spend a really long time rubbing it in, and it kept balling up in clumps. I’d be very hesitant to use it on my entire body. However, after spending almost an hour rubbing it in, the colour it gave me was dark and natural looking.  I would recommend using this product with gloves, because I scrubbed my hands with soap and an exfoliating mitt immediately after application, and my palms are still slightly orange. Since this product is on the pricey side, I probably wouldn’t buy it. Rating: 2/5” -Stephanie Woods&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

“Xen-Tan will be your best friend and your worst enemy! The thick, clay-like cream is a pain to apply, but once it's applied evenly the colour is phenomenal! It's the perfect shade of golden brown and lasts for a long time. I opted to apply it every other day which left people asking me when I found the time to go on vacation. My suggestion with this tanner is to use a moisturizer immediately after applying it to ensure you've sufficiently rubbed in the thick cream. Rating: 5/5” -Miranda Furtado&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;E! Live From the Red Carpet by Xen-Tan (Suggested retail price: $43.00; Available at xen-tan.com)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

“This by far was my least favourite out of all the tanners, which surprises me because it's made by the same brand as my absolute fave -- Xen-Tan. The theory behind this self-tanner is that you can turn the dial to create you own custom blend of self tanner and instant bronzer. To give this one a fair shot I opted to keep it at 50% of each the self-tanner and the instant bronzer. The colour of the bronzer wasn't great and I really didn't notice the self tanner at all. Rating 1/5. -Miranda Furtado&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Urban Decay Santa Tanita (Suggested retail price: $28; Available at Sephora)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

“Scottish/Irish skin does not a sun-worshipper make. We fair lassies love a good self tanner so I was excited to try Urban Decay’s Santa Tanita. It’s foam in a can, allowing for easy dispensing and even application.  I found it a cinch to apply and blend into my skin. It absorbs quickly and the results are instant. It looked very natural – there was absolutely no streaking thanks to its light mouse texture and there was no colour depositing on ankles, knees or elbows. It also didn’t leave marks on my towels and sheets. I should have stopped there. The next day I was still a nice light brown, but the additional dosage of ST proved to be a bit much for my pinker skin – the second layer made me look more orange than bronzed.  I also noticed with second application the “shimmer”.  While shimmer might be desirable for an evening event, or perhaps for a younger girl, I personally do not like the sparkly particles that all shimmer products seem to impart everywhere. The smell is fine – very little scent in fact which is a great change from the usual overwhelming tell-tale smell of almost all sunless tanners. Price is a small indulgence at $28 for just 100 ml, but the pretty packaging makes it a nice, girly pick-me-up treat.  It’s a great product for more olive-toned skin and for evening parties where you might like a little sparkle. It’s fine for light to medium skin-toned women as long as you only apply it every three or four days. Rating: 3/5" -Cynthia Benaicha&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

“This was another bomb in my trial and error week of self-tanning. Do I get tanned? Yes. Does it smell good? Yes. Do I want to look like a sparkly disco ball? No. As soon as I realized how shimmery it left my skin, I jumped in the shower and tried to wash it off. The only bright side of this self-tanner is that would be great for a night on the town. Rating 2/5” -Miranda Furtado&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
