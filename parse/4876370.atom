&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Schick Quattro for Women TrimStyle Sensitive (Suggested Retail Price: $12.99. Available at drug, mass and grocery retailers across Canada)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

“Man, this razor was a whole lot of presentation and very little execution. That electric trimmer at one end sure looks fancy, but in my three times using it, it alternated between refusing to stay on unless I held down the ‘on’ button with my thumb and refusing to turn off. And the trimmer wasn’t very effective either – definitely not effective enough to wave away the on/off problems. The regular, non-electric razor was nothing to write home about, either. If you spend the $12.99 on this razor/trimmer combo expecting an all-in-one solution to your shaving needs, you will be disappointed. Rating: 1/5” – Kat Angus&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

 

"I had bought this razor before, being drawn to the waterproof bikini-trimmer-in-one feature and was left disappointed. The trimmer stopped working after a few weeks! I decided to give it another shot but this time kept it dry and stored it outside of the shower. Inconvenient, but so far it’s still working. Warning for those that DO keep it in the shower - the suction cup holder it comes with will randomly come crashing down, scaring the bejeezus out of you in the middle of the night. There's nothing truly revolutionary about this razor. It does the job when the blades are sharp, reaching small or awkward places and the trimmer is 'meh'. But the guide comb on the trimmer is useless and I always remove it to get the results I want. It's affordable but the trimmer is unreliable. Save yourself the hassle and spend the money on a real trimmer. Rating 2/5." -Bonnie Large&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

 

"I love this product; I have used it before and feel it is a God send! It is a great two-in-one product with a four-blade razor and a waterproof trimmer. The actual shape is sleek with a non slip grip. The trimmer side is adjustable with three length settings and it includes the battery. It is a bit pricier than the others, bit nonetheless worth it! It gave me smooth results after the first shave and the razor has lasted for weeks. Rating: 5/5." -Yvonne Yip &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Venus ProSkin MoistureRich Razor (Suggested Retail Price: $10.99. The suggested retail price for replacement cartridges is $16.99. Available at Shoppers Drugmart)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;


“The Venus ProSkin Moisture RichRazor didn’t make my legs noticeably smoother and – even more annoying – I had to go over each part of my legs several times before they felt even a little bit smooth. Hey, razor manufacturers: If I have to press down on a razor to feel like I’m a getting a close shave, there is a major problem. At $10.99 for the razor and $16.99 for the refills, the MoistureRich Razor just isn’t worth it. Rating: 0/5” – Kat Angus&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

 

“I really didn’t expect to like this razor, since I doubted its claims that you wouldn’t need to use shaving cream or soap. But it turns out the built-in gel bars really do provide you with enough lather to achieve a close and comfortable shave. I brought it with me while travelling and it was a breeze – it worked well and I didn’t have to pack a can of shaving cream. The best part about this three-blade razor is that I haven’t experienced a nick or cut since I started using it, which wasn’t the case with my previous four-blade razor. Plus, it’s really easy to tell when it’s time to replace the cartridge: the gel bars harden and crack, and they won’t produce lather. I’ll definitely continue using it. Rating: 5/5” –Jen McDonnell&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

 

"I have been using a Venus razor for as long as I can remember so I’m always up for trying out their new products. The difference between this razor and my Venus Embrace is the MoistureRich gel bars above and below the 3 blades. This helps to create a smooth shave without having to use shaving cream (although I continued to use shaving cream after the first try since I am a fan of the stuff). This razor comes with two extra cartridges and a suction cup holder, which is always a bonus. However, the cost of the replacement cartridges is a little steep. This is a much smaller razor than the Schick Intuition and it produced the same results. I will definitely continue to use this one. Rating: 5/5" -Kim D'Amato&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;


“I don't need an endorsement from Jennifer Lopez, People Magazine's Queen of Pretty 2011, to know that Venus makes a great lady-razor. Its easy-to-grip handle, flexible head and triple-blade has delivered for me in the past. The Proskin Moisture Rich iteration of the razor did, too -- but, call me a purist, I could do without those patented gel bars. To the Venus razor's credit, just water and blade will do 'ya -- as promised. I achieved a clean shave, sans razor burn, in a single swipe. But a latherless shave is hardly an experience fit for a goddess (or triple-threat reality TV judge). (For one: since when have "goddesses" been hygiene-challenged slackers too lazy to put soap on their legs?) When wet, the gel bars melt into a floral-scented snot-like liquid -- that perpetually drips from the razor's edge like it has a runny nose. (You know, if razors had noses.) If combined with your regular soap or shave gel, this stuff can lead to one tricky shave. The Venus razor's bendable head is great for hugging your contours in any other situation. Add some super slippery lather, though, and it'll slide off-course unpredictably. (Mine took some freaky turns that had me fearing for major scrapes.) Thankfully -- or not -- the moisture bars wear down significantly after a week and a half of daily use. But then, you could have just bought the regular blades and saved yourself a couple bucks -- and, potentially, some band-aids. Rating: 3.5 out of 5” –Leah Collins&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Schick Intuition Limited Edition (Suggested Retail Price: $11.99 Available at major retail locations across Canada)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

“I’m not entirely sure why, but I’ve never really liked using shaving cream. It’s an extra step that my lazy self naturally eschews, and it certainly doesn’t help when the shower stream gets in the way and accidentally washes some of the shaving cream away before I’ve had the chance to use my razor. With that in mind, the Shick Intuition Renewing Moisture razor was perfect: it moisturized my skin as I was shaving and I didn’t have to worry about accidentally washing anything away. At first, I was worried that the moisturizing bar that surrounds the razor would make a close shave very difficult, but my legs were smoother than they were after using any of the other razors I tried. Rating: 5/5” – Kat Angus&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

 

"At first when I looked at the Schick Intuition Renewing Moisture razor I immediately thought it was going to end up on my list of things to never buy again -- but I was wrong! It ended up surpassing all negative preconceived notions -- by a landslide. Like Kat, at first I couldn't understand how I was going to get a smooth finish if the soap was surrounding the blades, but low and behold I got perfectly shaved and moisturized legs! As a bonus, there were virtually no soapy shaving gel suds to rinse out of the tub afterwards! Rating: 4.5/5" -Miranda Furtado&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

"I like anything that will save me time in the shower and save me from shaving cuts, but why does the handle of this razor have to be so freakin' huge? I can use the razor on my underarms and legs no problem, but it's tough to get smaller areas and awkward spaces like ankles and kneecaps. This four-blade razor gives me a nice, close shave that lasts up to 3 days and the hypo-allergenic shaving solid acts as a shaving soap which means I don't have to use any additional shaving creams or lotions. BUT the solid will only last for about 2 weeks and once it's dissolved down past the level of the razor blade, it's pretty much useless. Back to the additional shaving creams and lotions! If they could revise the soaping technology to last longer, I'd be a repeat costumer of this product. Otherwise, I'm left with blades that are still sharp and a big bulky head that fills up with shower water. Rating 3.5/5." -Bonnie Large&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

 

"Since I shave my legs every day, I need something that locks in moisture, so I loved the built-in lathering stick with aloe and vitamin E.  The four blades allow for a close shave that gets every hair and the razor head pivots to adjust to your legs.  The only negative is the handle size, which was a bit thick and awkward.  Still, I highly recommended. Rating: 4.5/5."  -Jennifer Simone&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

 

"This product did the job it was intended to do, but the handle was a bit too bulky for me. Even with the moisture stick solid attached to the razor, I felt the need to add a bit more body wash to lather up. The package says it lathers and moisturizes during shaving, but I still needed to use moisturizer afterwards. On the plus side, the four blades did a great job. The shower hanger was handy and I liked that it came with two refills. I also liked that the packaging was made with recyclable materials. Rating: 4.5/5." -Yvonne Yip&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

 

"I am pretty 50/50 about this one. I do enjoy the fact that I don’t need to use shaving cream and it definitely glided smoothly over my skin with no cuts or marks, but the razor itself was very big and bulky. I can really only use this razor on my legs because of its size and shape, which means I still need to have another razor on hand. My legs felt a little razor burned before I moisturized following my shower. Like all the other razors I’ve tried, this left my legs feeling smooth for a full day or so, and then the pesky hairs started to grow back. Most razors nowadays come with an additional cartridge as well as the shower hook and this one was no different. Overall, I did like this razor but I’m not sure if not having to use shaving cream makes it worth it. Rating: 4/5" -Kim D'Amato&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
