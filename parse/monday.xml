<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>It was the night that Oscar looked back to its future.</P><P>The Artist, a (mostly) silent movie, made in Los Angeles by French director Michel Hazanavicius - a film that pays tribute to the era before talking pictures - on Sunday became the first silent to win the Best Picture Oscar since the first Oscars in 1929. It is also the first black-and-white movie to win since Schindler's List in 1993.</P><P>In all, it won five Oscars, tying it with Hugo, a 3-D family film that also hearkens back to an earlier era of silent movies - the Dickensian story of an abandoned orphan that becomes director Martin Scorsese's plea for film.</P><P></P><P>--</P><P><I>Related: </I><A HREF="http://www.dose.ca/style/gallery.html?tag=galleryname&q=Oscars2012&page=0&title=Photos:%20Rate%20The%20Oscar%20Fashions&subtitle=See%20what%20the%20stars%20wore%20at%20the%202012%20Academy%20Awards" TARGET="_blank"><B><I>Oscar dresses</I></B></A><I>, </I><A HREF="http://www.dose.ca/movies/photogallery.html?id=6213008" TARGET="_blank"><B><I>best/worst moments</I></B></A></P><P></P><P>--</P><P></P><P>The Artist's French star, Jean Dujardin, won the Best Actor award for his (mostly) silent portrayal of George Valentin, a fictional silent film star whose career is ended by the advent of talkies. He has to fight back into the limelight with the help of a rising starlet, and also his faithful Jack Russell terrier, Uggie.</P><P>&quot;I love your country,&quot; Dujardin said, nearly three hours into the Oscar broadcast. &quot;In 1929, it wasn't Billy Crystal, but Douglas Fairbanks who hosted the first Oscar ceremony. Tickets cost $5 and it lasted 15 minutes. Times have changed.&quot;</P><P>Hazanavicius, who won the Best Director Oscar, thanked everyone, from the crew to Uggie, although he acknowledged that the dog probably didn't understand what he was saying because &quot;he's not that good.&quot;</P><P>He also thanked the movie itself: &quot;Its life is full of grace and it brings to us joy and happiness, and sometimes life is wonderful, and today is one of those days.&quot;</P><P>Meryl Streep was named Best Actress for her performance as Margaret Thatcher in The Iron Lady. It was her third Oscar in a record-setting 17 nominations.</P><P>&quot;When they called my name, I had a feeling I could hear half of America going, 'Oh no'&quot;, she said. Later, thanking her actor friends, she said, &quot;I really understand I'll never be up here again.&quot;</P><P>Canadian icon, Christopher Plummer, 82, became the oldest-ever Oscar winner when he was named Best Supporting Actor for his performance as a gay man who comes out of the closet after the death of his wife in the film, Beginners.</P><P>&quot;You're only two years older than me, darling,&quot; he said to the 84-year-old Oscar. &quot;Where have you been all my life?&quot; It is Plummer's first-ever Academy Award.</P><P>It wasn't all glory for Canada, though. The Iranian film, A Separation, which looks at the tragedies that result when a couple applies for a divorce, won the Oscar as Best Foreign Language Film, defeating Canada's entry, the Quebec drama, Monsieur Lazhar. (In Darkness, another nominee, is a Polish-Canadian co-production.)</P><P>Asghar Farhadi, director of A Separation, gave an acceptance speech that hinted at the problems - &quot;tug of war, intimidation and aggressions exchanged between politicians&quot; - between Iran and much of the Western world.</P><P>&quot;I proudly offer this award to the people of my country, the people who respect all cultures and civilizations and despise hostility and resentment,&quot; he said.</P><P>Octavia Spencer, who stole scenes as the sassy maid in the civil-rights drama, The Help, was named Best Supporting Actress. Spencer, who had been favoured to win, gave a tearful speech, in which she thanked everyone, from her family in Alabama to the entire state of Alabama.</P><P>The absent Woody Allen won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for Midnight in Paris, a comic fantasy about a man who goes back in time to the golden age of France - another story that basked in the glow of nostalgia for an earlier culture. The Descendants, the George Clooney movie about a man whose unfaithful wife is in a coma, won the award for Best Adapted Screenplay.</P><P>Rango, about a chameleon that becomes a gunfighter in the Old West, was named best Animated Feature Film.</P><P>Undefeated, the story of an underdog football team, was named Best Feature Documentary while Saving Face, about acid attacks on women in Pakistan, was Best Documentary Short Subject.</P><P>The Iron Lady - which took Streep's Thatcher from middle to old age - won the Oscar for best makeup. In a field of just two nominees, Man or Muppet, the song from The Muppets, was named Best Original Song.</P><P>Two movies from the National Film Board, Dimanche and Wild Life, had been nominated as Best Animated Short Film. They are the 71st and 72nd movies from the NFB to be nominated, and the first double nomination in the same category in its history. However, the award went to the American film, The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore.</P><P>The Irish film The Shore was named best Live Action Short.</P><P>In the early technical awards, it looked as if Hugo, cast as the (ital)other(unital) movie about movies, was going to eclipse The Artist. Scorsese's film won Oscars for visual effects, art direction, the cinematography of Robert Richardson, and both sound editing and sound mixing, while The Artist won just two, for Mark Bridges' costume design and Ludovic Bource's score.</P><P>The Artist and Hugo are part of the reason that this year's awards, more than any in memory, have inspired anxious soul-searching among Oscar-watchers about what it all means. The consensus is that Hollywood is on the cusp of great changes - toward digital cinema, 3-D, and, increasingly, films that resemble video games - and that this year's Academy Awards are the industry's way of looking fondly back to a golden era.</P><P>The Artist, which was the front-runner for a Best Picture Oscar, was universally regarded as &quot;charming,&quot; but dismissed by some critics as a condescending pastiche of tropes that leaves out the ferocity, the edge, and, ironically, the &quot;art&quot; of the real thing. Critics questioned if a movie that is merely entertaining, even joyful, is worthy of being named the best of the year, even though the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences enlarged its list of nominees specifically to include such films. In previous years, it was the movies that didn't stoop to mere entertainment, let alone joy - films such as the 2004 drama, Crash - that have gone home with the hardware.</P><P>The nostalgia of many of the Best Picture nominees also raises the question of age: A Los Angeles Times survey found that the 5,765 voting members of the academy were overwhelmingly old white men, with a median age of 62. Even the evening's host, Billy Crystal, is a 63-year-old veteran: In his opening routine, which elaborately placed him into many of the nominated movies, Justin Bieber popped up to say, &quot;I'm here to give you the 18-to-24 demographic.&quot;</P><P></P><P>Winners:</P><P>ACTOR IN A LEAD ROLE</P><P>Jean Dujardin in &quot;The Artist&quot;</P><P></P><P>DIRECTING</P><P>&quot;The Artist&quot; Michel Hazanavicius</P><P></P><P>SHORT FILM (ANIMATED)</P><P>&quot;The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore&quot; William Joyce and Brandon Oldenburg</P><P></P><P>DOCUMENTARY (SHORT SUBJECT)</P><P>&quot;Saving Face&quot; Daniel Junge and Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy</P><P></P><P>SHORT FILM (LIVE ACTION)</P><P>&quot;The Shore&quot; Terry George and Oorlagh George</P><P></P><P>WRITING (ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY) </P><P>&quot;Midnight in Paris&quot; Written by Woody Allen</P><P></P><P>WRITING (ADAPTED SCREENPLAY)</P><P>&quot;The Descendants&quot; Screenplay by Alexander Payne and Nat Faxon &amp; Jim Rash</P><P></P><P>MUSIC (ORIGINAL SONG)</P><P>&quot;Man or Muppet&quot; from &quot;The Muppets&quot; Music and Lyric by Bret McKenzie</P><P></P><P>MUSIC (ORIGINAL SCORE)</P><P>&quot;The Artist&quot; Ludovic Bource</P><P></P><P>ACTOR IN A SUPPORTING ROLE</P><P>Christopher Plummer in &quot;Beginners&quot;</P><P></P><P>VISUAL EFFECTS</P><P>&quot;Hugo&quot; Rob Legato, Joss Williams, Ben Grossman and Alex Henning</P><P></P><P>ANIMATED FEATURE FILM</P><P>&quot;Rango&quot; Gore Verbinski</P><P></P><P>DOCUMENTARY (FEATURE)</P><P>&quot;Undefeated&quot; TJ Martin, Dan Lindsay and Richard Middlemas</P><P></P><P>SOUND MIXING</P><P>&quot;Hugo&quot; Tom Fleischman and John Midgley</P><P></P><P>SOUND EDITING</P><P>&quot;Hugo&quot; Philip Stockton and Eugene Gearty</P><P></P><P>FILM EDITING</P><P>&quot;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&quot; Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall</P><P></P><P>ACTRESS IN A SUPPORTING ROLE</P><P>Octavia Spencer in &quot;The Help&quot;</P><P></P><P>FOREIGN LANGUAGE FILM</P><P>&quot;A Separation&quot; Iran</P><P></P><P>MAKEUP</P><P>&quot;The Iron Lady&quot; Mark Coulier and J.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>&quot;You don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows,&quot; but these days, a guide through the seemingly endless flurry of pop culture is just what we need. With that in mind, here is what's on the radar screen in TV, music and film for the coming week.</P><P></P><P>• <B>Movies</B></P><P><B>Big release:</B> Dr. Seuss' The Lorax (March 2)</P><P><B>Big picture: </B>We start with a fake, plastic, treeless city, in which everything is big, synthetic and soulless. (It's like Las Vegas, only animated -and, presumably, minus the gambling and prostitution). Enter our hero, young Ted (voiced by Zac Efron), who goes on a quest to find a real tree to please his boyhood crush, Audrey (voiced by singer Taylor Swift). Along the way, he meets an orange, furry creature called The Lorax, whose environmental talking points make Al Gore look like an oil tycoon. The Lorax eventually entrusts Ted with &quot;the last seed,&quot; in the hopes of planting a new future.</P><P>The Lorax tells us, &quot;Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better, it's not.&quot; (On a side note, politicians should really be mining Dr. Seuss's books for slogans. For example: &quot;After all, a person's a person, no matter how small,&quot; or, for the Republicans, &quot;I meant what I said, and I said what I meant - an elephant's faithful 100 per cent!&quot;)</P><P><B>Forecast:</B> You had us at Dr. Seuss, and the message in his 1971 children's book is just as relevant today. The added bonus? The always delightful Danny DeVito brings to life the long-whiskered Lorax (who looks kind of like cartoon legend Yosemite Sam, if he turned into a werewolf).</P><P><B>Honourable Mention:</B> Project X (March 2). Imagine a cross between spring break on Daytona Beach, Fight Club and the Thunderdome from Mad Max. From producer Todd Phillips (The Hangover), this comedy follows three unassuming, unpopular teenagers who throw a house party gone wrong. A giant house fire, a violent midget, a violent horse, violent stupidity, a parade of bikinis, and general, destructive chaos ensue. This is a parent's worst nightmare.</P><P></P><P></P><P>• <B>TV</B></P><P><B>Big event: </B>Awake (March 1; NBC, Global, 10 ET/PT)</P><P><B>Big picture:</B> This one has a fascinating, quirky premise (David Lynch would be proud). After a devastating car crash, Michael Britten (Jason Isaacs) begins living two parallel, alternating lives. In one reality, only his wife survived the trauma; in the other, only his son. As a detective, Michael has different cases and different partners in each world -and even two different therapists. Our confused hero is never quite sure whether he is awake or dreaming. (On a side note, Keith Richards suffered from this same syndrome throughout much of the '60s and '70s.)</P><P><B>Forecast:</B> Inventive and original, Awake is worth staying awake for. &quot;When it comes to letting one of them go, I have no desire to ever make progress,&quot; Michael tells one of his therapists. I tell my psychiatrist the same thing about the alternative reality I go to each night, in which I'm married to Scarlett Johansson, own the world's last unicorn, and am a renowned astronaut-magician. (Note: Please don't tell my wife from THIS reality.)</P><P><B>Honourable mentions:</B> GCB (March 4; ABC, Citytv, 10 ET/PT). The show's ex-title, Good Christian Bitches, tells you all you need to know. Now coined Good Christian Belles, this comedy-drama is based on the popular book by Kim Gatlin. The series stars Leslie Bibb as a newly divorced single mother who returns to her hometown of Dallas, where she used to rule her high school as a total . . . &quot;belle.&quot;</P><P></P><P></P><P>• <B>Music</B></P><P><B>Big release on Feb. 28: </B>Plants and Animals (The End of That)</P><P><B>Big picture: </B>The talented Montreal indie rockers are back with their third album. With compelling vocals, infectious guitar hooks and head-bobbing percussion, the band has returned to the form of their critically acclaimed debut, Parc Avenue. The band took their time with this one in the studio, and the result is a more ambitious, cohesive effort. While the lyrics often focus on alienation and loneliness, loneliness never sounded so fun and danceable.</P><P><B>Forecast:</B> In a week where The Lorax is urging us to go green, these Plants &amp; Animals also deserve your attention. The band is a worthy contemporary of Arcade Fire's, whose big star often unfairly outshines other members of Montreal's thriving music scene. And they are one of the best live acts in the country, so watch out for the pending tour.</P><P></P><P><B>Honourable mention: </B>Estelle (All of Me): The Grammy-award winning British R&amp;B artist returns to try and steal some of the spotlight away from fellow countrywoman, Adele.</P><P></P>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>We've been on a search for a product that straightens our hair, cuts down on drying time and eliminates frizz. This week, we tested LaCoupe's orgnx Brazilian Keratin 14 Day Smoothing Treatment and Aftercare Collection. The kit promises to effortlessly achieve long-lasting salon results, reduce of frizz and give us smooth, silky hair.</P><P></P><P>The products range from $9.99-$12.99 and are available exclusively at Shoppers Drugmart.</P><P></P><P>Have you tried it? Leave your own review in the comments section below.  </P><P></P><P>--</P><P>&quot;Kinky-curls transformed into hair that's smooth and straight? Sure, I maintained that look for 14 days while using La Coupe Orgnx's Brazilian Keratin Complex system. But let's consider some of the styling instructions, first: six bottles of sweet, herbal-scented goo aren't going to Cher-ify your hair. A regular blitz of blow-drying and flat-ironing is what's going to produce results -- and as the instructions for step 1 of the system, the 14-Day Styling Cream, suggest, you’d better be giving each section of hair &quot;4-5&quot; swipes of the flat iron. Even curls as tight as mine will go sleek with less firepower.</P><P></P><P>But yes, the products: in a weird twist, I'd recommend any of them to curly girls (or otherwise) who love their flat-irons. All except one of them -- and it’s the item at the centre of this whole system, the 14 Day Smoothing Cream. It gave me the look, sure. But it also gave me a nasty case of product build-up -- one so bad that I couldn't run my fingers through my hair. The recommended 48-hour waiting period between shampoos became socially awkward agony. (When one friend cooed, trying to play with my transformed locks, I recoiled. Nobody likes having to admit their coif is the texture of wet cotton candy.)</P><P></P><P>Thankfully, the shampoo/conditioner combo rinsed the gunk out (after three washings). Subsequent stylings were incident-free, thanks to the system's satisfactory heat-spray, blowout styling cream and conditioning masque. (The latter, incidentally, was my absolute favourite of the bunch; you'll be hard-pressed to find a better detangler.) Rating: 2/5. </P><P></P><P>--Leah Collins/Dose.ca</P><P></P><P>--</P><P>&quot;I have naturally curly hair and am inherently lazy, so any product that helps me maintain straight hair with very little effort is aces in my books! Not that this process was a total cake walk; though the results lasted a while, the application was intense. I started with the clarifying shampoo, which strips product/toxins out of your hair. Since I couldn't follow it up with conditioner, brushing through the tangles was a headache (literally). But eventually I got to a stage where I could run gobs of the smoothing treatment through my towel-dried tresses. I slathered it all over my shoulder-length hair and barely managed to use half the tube, which means I'll be able to repeat the application at least one more time without buying another kit (bonus!).</P><P></P><P>After leaving it on for an hour, I washed it out and then followed the very detailed instructions, blow-drying my hair meticulously and then straight-ironing it, going over each section multiple times. The result was soft, shiny, pin-straight hair (though I'm sure with that much blow-drying/straightening, I could have achieved the same results without the pre-treatment).</P><P></P><P>The real test came two days later. I had yet to wash my hair (as per instructed) and I got caught in a snowstorm without a hat. Usually, once a sprinkle hits my head, my hair curls up in a way that would make Annie blush, but when I came indoors and brushed the snow out of my hair, my locks were still as straight as before and I was completely frizz-free. Impressive!</P><P></P><P>Unfortunately, the results didn't last 14 days as promised, but I still managed to make it about a week before my natural waves/frizz crept back. </P><P></P><P>The kit comes with a whole lot of product, much of which I didn't use. It includes sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner (though after a few days I switched back to my regular product, which is also sulfate-free but without Orgnx’s sickeningly sweet scent) and flatiron spray (which I didn't use because the product worked so well, I was usually able to get by with just a quick blow-dry). I did, however, use the blowstyling cream before each blow-dry.</P><P></P><P>In the end, I ended up investing about an hour of application time (treatment, blow-drying, and flat-ironing) for approximately one week of straight, frizz-free hair. It still required quick blow-dries, but I was able to cut out my usual flat-ironing step altogether. Since I'd rather spend some weekend time prepping my hair than flat-ironing it every morning, I'd definitely try this again (especially before vacationing in humid climates). The low price point doesn't hurt, either.&quot; Rating: 3.5/5</P><P></P><P>-Jen McDonnell</P><P></P><P>--</P><P>&quot;I blow-dry and flat-iron my hair almost every day, and I envy women with long, naturally straight hair. I dream of the day I can let my hair air-dry without a thick layer of frizz. My hair is naturally curly, frizzy and generally unattractive (think 80’s rock band), so I was thrilled to try out the LaCoupe orgnx 14 Day Keratin Smoothing Treatment. I was tired of blowing out my hair for 45 minutes to get it only partially straight, and then having to go over each section with a flat-iron for that perfect, smooth look. </P><P></P><P>The application was relatively easy, providing you follow the instructions diligently. I have a lot of hair and it’s quite long, so the entire process took about an hour and half. I wanted to make sure my hair was perfectly smooth, with no rogue kinks or curls, so my drying time took longer than I expected. </P><P></P><P>After the treatment, my hair looked and felt amazing. It was softer, silkier, and overall more manageable than usual. Even after a few washes, the treatment cut my drying time in half, as I didn’t have to go over each section of hair multiple times to get it straight.  The blowout styling cream and heat protectant spray worked wonders to keep my hair frizz-free over the 14 days. I even let my hair air-dry a few times (which I usually wouldn’t dare to do, and it dried curly and shiny with very minimal frizz.  I did notice towards the end of the 14 days that my hair was slowly returning back to its original state, but depending on how often you wash your hair, it could last longer. </P><P></P><P>I would definitely try this collection again. The prices of each product can’t be beat when compared to the cost of a pricey salon keratin treatment.&quot; Rating: 4.5/5 </P><P></P><P>-Jenna Downing</P>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P><I>Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston sleepwalk through a limp script about an urban couple who end up joining a cult. While the nutty characters and nudist-dependent sight gags are supposed to keep us laughing, this movie from David Wain (Role Models) is really just a sad investigation of the endangered American middle class. </I><B><I></I></B></P><P><B></B></P><P><B>Starring</B>: Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd</P><P></P><P><B>Rating</B>: Two stars out of five</P><P></P><P>Imagine Martha Marcy May Marlene with a laugh track, or Jonestown with a jukebox playing the music from the Big Chill, and you get a good sense of the creepy edge on Wanderlust.</P><P>Hoping to slake the popular thirst for life-affirming, lowest-common-denominator romance, this underwhelming movie from David Wain stirs up some Kool-Aid comedy from the tattered remnants of the American Middle class.</P><P>George (Paul Rudd) and Linda (Jennifer Aniston) are an ordinary couple struggling to make it in the Big Apple. They accept their fate on the bottom rung, but are intent to climb out of their cramped studio apartment and make it to the penthouse one day, because that's the dream.</P><P>George and Linda bought into the promise of a better tomorrow, but the blinders are coming off in a hurry: George just lost his office job to the financial crisis and Linda's great ambition of making documentaries about penguins with cancer recently spiralled in a development meeting with HBO.</P><P>That's a joke, by the way: Penguins with cancer is a comic motif that waddles all the way through this laugh-challenged effort.</P><P>It fits right alongside the other stale-dated devices, including a car in the swamp, a mixed-race couple who talk about being a mixed-race couple, a hippie with dementia and a long-haired Lothario who believes in free love, man.</P><P>There's also a viper-faced feminist, a wine-making nudist and a libidinous nymphette, because, without off-the-rack caricatures to fill the frame, this movie would be an earnest training video for marriage counsellors.</P><P>In fact, we could use a little Dr. Phil by the halfway point, because there's not enough plot to keep the narrative chugging -- even with the half dozen support staff from central casting.</P><P>The basic outlines of the movie seem workable: George and Linda become statistics in a changing economy. Without work, George is forced to move back to his hometown and work for his older brother, a porta-potty mogul who wears his cellphone on his belt and drives a Cadillac Escalade.</P><P>That's another joke, by the way -- because grotesque symbols of over-consumption and bad taste are hilarious, especially when you're a bitter sophisticate whose gifts have been overlooked by a shallow society.</P><P>There's not much charity behind these cardboard stereotypes, and that's probably the biggest problem in this movie about George and Linda's bid to join a commune: There's so much anger and resentment lurking behind each cut-out, everyone starts to feel loathsome and petty by the second act.</P><P>Paul Rudd is the kind of actor who can make neurotic weakness seem attractive, because he's cute and smart, but even he is flattened by the slow-moving steamroller of cliche.</P><P>Aniston suffers a similar fate, and it's the same snag that has limited her entire career to date: She's stuck in the twilight zone of feminine expectation.</P><P>She's supposed to be nice, but also capable of snapping edgy zingers. She's supposed to be sexy, but simultaneously wholesome. She's supposed to be the gal next door, but not without a hint of hormonal urgency.</P><P>No one can straddle such distances without destroying a few hamstrings of believability, and Aniston is starting to look weary from the stretches.</P><P>Even acting opposite her current flame Justin Theroux, who plays the playboy in plaid, Aniston looks exhausted by her own image.</P><P>The same could be said for everyone, including Alan Alda, who takes on the role of the aging hippie. The characters have no relief, no edge, and no redeeming element of surprise. They almost seem to bore themselves.</P><P>The only moments when the movie feels truly alive are when Wain flashes his fangs and sinks his teeth into some meaty issue of manhood, or mocking the bourgeoisie.</P><P>The very best character is the alcoholic wife who shops on Skymall -- the inflight magazine -- and really, that's not saying much about the script.</P><P>A very sad, and frequently mean-spirited, examination of the endangered American middle class, this comedy about recreating the status quo only makes our escapist urge feel cheap.</P><P></P><P></P>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>If the <A HREF="http://www.dose.ca/special_coverage/awardshowhq/index.html" TARGET="_blank"><B>Oscars</B></A> have an official dress-code, nobody's ever bothered to tell Bjork or Gwyneth (<A HREF="http://www.dose.ca/style/photogallery.html?id=2588127" TARGET="_blank"><B>or anybody on this list</B></A>), and yet, <I>Deadline</I> reported that the Academy was ready to boot Sacha Baron Cohen from this year's show if he dared to appear in costume as Adm. Gen. Aladeen, his character in upcoming comedy <I>The Dictator</I>.  </P><P></P><P>Five years of morons doing bad Borat impressions has all been forgiven, it seems. They just really don't want to see any Republic of Wadiya swag on E!'s 360 degree glam cam. Still, this has all been excellent publicity for Baron Cohen (whom you possibly forgot was even involved in one of this year's best picture nominees, <I>Hugo</I>), and though the likelihood of his character, Adm. Gen. Aladeen, photo-bombing Brangelina at the <I>Vanity Fair</I> after-party has been somewhat diminished, he's been making ample pre-Oscar appearances, including an interview with the <I>Today Show</I> this morning, where he responded to the Academy's ban.</P><P></P><P>&quot;Usually I would be impressed by an act of cowardice by a faceless regime,&quot; Baron Cohen said, calling into the program in character. &quot;But this is personal.&quot; </P><P></P><P>&quot;Aladeen&quot; made a separate address to the Academy earlier, posting a video to <I>The Dictator</I>'s official website, where he once more expressed his &quot;outrage&quot; and gave novelty t-shirt manufacturers a head-start on designing this year's best-selling catchphrase tee. </P><P></P><P>The transcript:</P><P></P><P>&quot;Good morning, great Satan of America. How are you? I am fine, thank you. On behalf of the nation of Wadiya, I am outraged at being banned from the Oscars by the Academy of Motion Pictures, Arts and Zionists.</P><P></P><P>&quot;While I applaud the Academy for taking away my right to free speech, I warn you that if you do not lift your sanctions and give me my tickets back by 12 p.m. on Sunday, you will face unimaginable consequences. ... On top of all of this, I paid Hillary Swank $2 million to be my date and she will not refund a penny. My Sunday calendar is now as empty as a North Korean grocery store.</P><P></P><P>&quot;But whatever happens, I still plan to attend director Brett Ratner's after-party, since it is impossible to catch herpes twice. Death to the West. Death to America. And good luck, Billy Crystal. You're fantastic!&quot;</P><P></P><P>(Now that all the jokes have been ruined, please note that the video, along with Baron Cohen’s <I>Today Show</I> interview, has been posted below.)</P><P></P><P>If you consider <I>Borat</I> to be a fine example of verite-style documentary filmmaking, please note that Baron Cohen regularly appears in character. In 2009, for instance, he attended the MTV Movie Awards as Austrian fashion reporter Bruno -- sailing over the crowd as a bare-assed cupid, only to land in Eminem's lap. </P><P></P><P>He's previously been discouraged from attending the Oscars, however. Cohen was asked to be an Oscar presenter in 2007, but as MTV notes, he turned down the offer when the Academy rejected his idea of presenting in character as Borat.</P><P></P><P><B>Watch Baron Cohen's interview on the Today Show:</B></P><object width="420" height="245" id="msnbc5c7daa" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=10,0,0,0"><param name="movie" value="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32545640" /><param name="FlashVars" value="launch=46510858&amp;width=420&amp;height=245" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="wmode" value="transparent" /><embed name="msnbc5c7daa" src="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32545640" width="420" height="245" FlashVars="launch=46510858&amp;width=420&amp;height=245" allowscriptaccess="always" allowFullScreen="true" wmode="transparent" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" pluginspage="http://www.adobe.com/shockwave/download/download.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash"></embed></object><p style="font-size:11px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #999; margin-top: 5px; background: transparent; text-align: center; width: 420px;">Visit msnbc.com for <a style="text-decoration:none !important; border-bottom: 1px dotted #999 !important; font-weight:normal !important; height: 13px; color:#5799DB !important;" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com">breaking news</a>, <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032507" style="text-decoration:none !important; border-bottom: 1px dotted #999 !important; font-weight:normal !important; height: 13px; color:#5799DB !important;">world news</a>, and <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032072" style="text-decoration:none !important; border-bottom: 1px dotted #999 !important; font-weight:normal !important; height: 13px; color:#5799DB !important;">news about the economy</a></p><P></P><P><B>Watch Admiral General Aladeen's message to the Academy:</B></P><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/3AAvRyro6_Y" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><P></P><P><A HREF="mailto:leahc@dose.ca" TARGET="_blank">leahc@dose.ca</A></P>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>Have you been wondering where Gerard Butler has been the last few weeks? Yeah, neither have we, but according to reports, the actor has been spending the past few weeks at the Betty Ford clinic. </P><P></P><P>No, the notorious ladies’ man isn't in treatment for sex addiction. <A HREF="http://www.tmz.com/2012/02/24/gerard-butler-rehab-addiction-prescription-drugs-alcohol-cocaine/" TARGET="_blank"><B><I>TMZ</I></B></A> claims Butler is seeking help for substance abuse issues. </P><P></P><P>According to the site, Butler became addicted to painkillers, stemming from the physical demands of shooting <I>300</I> in 2006. </P><P></P><P>The problem reportedly escalated after Butler suffered an injury in December while on the set of <I>Of Men and Mavericks</I>. Butler was thrown off of his surfboard by waves at least 12 feet high before being stuck underwater for two consecutive waves. When he finally surfaced, the actor was hit by four or five more waves.</P><P></P><P>Butler recently told the <A HREF="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2105788/Gerard-Butler-rehab-Actor-checks-Betty-Ford-relying-heavily-prescription-pain-relief.html" TARGET="_blank"><B><I>Daily Mail</I></B></A>, “It was a pretty close call. The waves just took me in, and I couldn’t get up. It was pretty hairy. It was maybe of the few times that reports were not exaggerated.”</P><P></P><P><I>TMZ</I> reports that the actor realized that he had a problem and headed off to the treatment center three weeks ago. </P><P></P><P>Butler is reportedly being released later today.</P><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dose.ca%2Fcelebrity%2FGerard%2BButler%2BRehab%2BReport%2F6204635%2Fstory.html&media=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dose.ca%2Fcelebrity%2F6204645.bin&description=Gerard%20Butler%20in%20rehab" class="pin-it-button" count-layout="horizontal">Pin It</a><script type="text/javascript" src="http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinit.js"></script>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>It’s all starting to make sense now. Chris Brown isn’t really the least likeable celebrity on the planet. Obviously, he’s just in the midst of an extensive scientific experiment to test how far he can push the limits of bad behavior before karma squishes him like shoe gum. How else to explain his latest alleged angry outburst?</P><P></P><P>We all know that a picture is worth a thousand words -- but in Brown's case, it could actually land him in behind bars. According to a <A HREF="http://www.tmz.com/2012/02/23/chris-brown-district-attorney-miami-rihanna-probation-robbery/?adid=hero1" TARGET="_blank"><B>police report </B></A>filed by Christal Shanae Spann, Brown stole Spann's iPhone at 4 a.m. on Sunday after she tried to snap a picture of him leaving a nightclub in Miami, Florida. </P><P></P><P>According to the police report, fans (including Spann) spotted Brown and Young Money rapper Tyga exiting the Cameo club through a back door and followed them to their waiting cars. After Spann took a photo, Brown reached through the window of his Bentley and took her iPhone from her hands, saying, &quot;B----, you ain't going to put that on no website” before rolling out. </P><P></P><P>No charges have been filed yet but prosecutors are looking into the situation. &quot;My prosecutors are currently speaking with witnesses and reviewing all of the materials supplied by Miami Beach Police,&quot; Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle told People. &quot;Only after these reviews have been completed would any type of action be considered or taken.&quot; </P><P></P><P>According to <I>E! News</I>, the Florida State Attorney's Office is allegedly prepping a warrant for the singer's arrest on &quot;robbery by sudden snatching.&quot; </P><P></P><P>Brown is midway through a five-year probation term for assaulting then-girlfriend Rihanna at a pre-Grammy party in 2009. If convicted, Brown could be seeing the inside of a jail cell for several years for breaking the terms of his probation, which require him to follow all laws. </P><P></P><P>The police aren't the only ones after the singer. In a <A HREF="http://www.howtobeatupanything.com/home/2012/02/thousand-dollar-bounty-offered-on-chris-brown.html " TARGET="_blank"><B>blog post</B></A>, comedian Kevin Seccia has offered a $1,000 prize to &quot;the first person to deliver proof that they hit Brown with at least two solid punches.&quot;</P><P></P><P>The comedian clarified that his offer is &quot;partially a joke and partially a way to bring some measure of pain and discomfort (non-physical) to a terrible, vicious human being who deserves far worse. HOWEVER, if you were to hit him and then email me video proof of that beating, I would absolutely, one hundred percent guaranteed send you a thousand dollars.&quot;</P><a href="http://pinterest.com/dosedotca/"><img

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>Justin Bieber isn't letting anything get in the way of a party. The teen idol declares his dedication to good times in his new collab with Far East Movement, the fist-pumping dance track, &quot;Live My Life.&quot; </P><P></P><P>Biebz opens the song with his hook (&quot;I'm gonna live my life/ No matter what/ We party tonight/ I'm gonna live, live, live my life/ I know that we gonna be all right&quot;), and also contributes a few &quot;woo woo woos.&quot; </P><P></P><P>The RedOne-produced club anthem is the lead single off FEM's <I>Dirty Bass</I>, which is expected to land this spring. The track will be available on iTunes Tuesday, and a video for &quot;Live My Life&quot; be filmed in the coming weeks. Another remix featuring LMFAO's Redfoo is expected soon. </P><P></P><P>&quot;We're thrilled to have Justin be a part of Dirty Bass,&quot; rapper Kev Nish of the LA hip-hop-influenced electronic group told RollingStone.com about the track. &quot;Far East Movement has always focused on unexpected collaborations and mashing up musical genres, which keeps making music exciting.  'Live My Life' is a song we think both Far East Movement and Bieber fans will enjoy together.&quot;</P><P></P><P>As for how Bieber hooked up with the guys from FEM, MTV reports they were introduced by Snoop Dogg at the Billboard Music Awards last year.</P><object height="81" width="100%"><param name="movie" value="https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F37614641&"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed allowscriptaccess="always" height="81" src="https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F37614641&" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="100%"></embed></object><span><a href="http://soundcloud.com/cherrytreerecords/far-east-movement-ft-justin">Far East Movement (ft.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P><I>In this comedy about hockey fighting, Seann William Scott plays a talentless enforcer who succeeds because he can wallop other guys. Whatever crass humour there may be in this movie is buried under a lot of over-the-top violence and juvenile vulgarity. </I><B></B></P><P><B></B></P><P><B>Starring</B>: Seann William Scott, Alison Pill, Liev Schreiber, Jay Baruchel</P><P></P><P><B>Rating</B>: Two stars out of five</P><P></P><P>&quot;I went to the fights the other night, and a hockey game broke out.&quot; It's an old joke, but, wait a minute: Hockey, fights, and an old joke ... sounds like a movie.</P><P>And voila: Goon, the latest attempt to translate the peculiar Canadian talents of self-deprecating humour and guys on skates pounding the crap out of one another into a hit comedy. The result is a 92-minute misconduct penalty.</P><P>Goon is the story of a hockey enforcer, loosely based on the career of Doug Smith, who was a boxer who learned how to skate. It's also inspired by the documentary, The Chiefs, about the Laval Chiefs, a team in the all-fighting, all-the-time North American Hockey League. The Chiefs is stranger than fiction; Goon is not only stranger, but also a lot more vulgar.</P><P>It stars an appealingly vacuous Seann William Scott as Doug Glatt, a professional bouncer at a bar, who is hired by a minor-league team when he beats up a player who has come right into the stands to battle a hostile crowd. Doug can't skate -- he comes to practice wearing figure skates and pushes along on his ankles -- but he sure can wallop guys, and Goon fairly drips blood, along with the occasional tooth. People who enjoy red gore on the blue line will be in arrested-development heaven.</P><P>Doug comes from a family of Jewish doctors -- Eugene Levy, Scott's American Pie co-star, has a cameo as his perpetually aggrieved father -- and you keep waiting for this oddity to pay off in a joke about, say, Moishe &quot;The Rocket&quot; Richard. There's finally a scene where someone holds up a sign reading, &quot;Glatt is Hebrew For F--- You.&quot;</P><P>That, alas, is typical. Goon is frequently offside, especially when Doug's buddy Pat (co-writer Jay Baruchel) is around to push the tone of gross-out boy's-town juvenilia. When Doug has to pick a sweater number, Pat yells out, &quot;Take the number 69! It's hilarious!&quot;</P><P>Guess again, Pat.</P><P>Anyway, Doug soon moves up to a higher-calibre team (&quot;Imagine if you played in a league where they actually play hockey,&quot; his coach says), the Halifax Highlanders. His job is to protect star forward Xavier Laflamme (C.R.A.Z.Y.'s Marc-Andre Grondin), a sort of Sidney Crosby with a lobotomy. Angry, burnt-out and strangely hostile to his own protector, Laflamme has been sent down from the Montreal Canadiens because he was hit so hard, he suffered a concussion and hasn't been the same player since.</P><P>The guy who hit him, Ross Rhea (Liev Schreiber, persuasively intimidating), is an aging enforcer who has also been demoted, and it's only a matter of time before he and Doug have it out. Meanwhile, Doug is falling for Eva (Alison Pill, familiar as Zelda Fitzgerald in Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris), who is supposed to be promiscuous. &quot;I'm horny a lot. I sleep around,&quot; Eva says, but you have to take her word for it, because she seems kind of innocent in the same way that her Zelda seemed a little too sane.</P><P>Goon was directed by Michael Dowse, who found an empty-headed sweetness in the hoser-loser Fubar films, and almost accomplishes the same thing here. Doug is a vicious naif, and Scott's performance is a charming -- if scarred -- combination of black eyes and yearning. And some of the running gags -- like Ogilvey (Richard Clarkin), the team captain who compares every situation to the pain of his own divorce -- have the manic air of stupid-on-purpose that Baruchel and co-writer Evan Goldberg (Pineapple Express) appear to be aiming for.</P><P>But too much of Goon is stupid-to-no-purpose: the Russian players who pretend to have sex with a goalie mask, the casual homophobia, the loving attention to the blood of hockey fights, Pat's coarse hectoring. Hockey enforcers can be funny when they're comic relief, like the Hanson brothers in Slap Shot, but Goon puts its marginal players at centre ice. Like their real-life counterparts, it's too much of a bad thing.</P><P></P>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>In news that manages to be both incredibly &quot;now&quot; and yet so 2006, Paris Hilton makes her return to music today, releasing a music video for &quot;Drunk Text.&quot;</P><P></P><P>The track, which features Hilton disaffectedly speak-singing over a fuzzy, house beat, is no &quot;Stars are Blind.&quot; But then -- like many a celebutante-fronted music video -- what is? </P><P></P><P>Still, there are so many things to be learned from &quot;Drunk Text!&quot; Things like, don't drink and text -- and where the hell has Paris Hilton been all these years?</P><P></P><P>The answer to that question: she's been hiding her lazy-eye in some nightclub all this time, just as we expected -- doing vodka shots, hanging with shadowy DJs (in this case, Denver, CO duo Manufactured Superstars) and muttering to herself over the sounds throbbing off the dancefloor.</P><P></P><P>Other important lessons gleaned from the spoken-word wisdom of &quot;Drunk Text,&quot; which we've summarized in easy-to-SMS point-form:</P><P></P><P><I>-&quot;No one is safe in the Twittersphere anymore.&quot;</I></P><P></P><P><I>-Paris' friend &quot;Adam&quot; can identify women based on nothing but a grainy upskirt photo.</I></P><P></P><P><I>-&quot;You take the word sex and mix it with texting, it's called sexting.&quot; </I></P><P></P><P><I>-&quot;When you add drunk to sexting, the words don't make sense.&quot;</I></P><P></P><P><I>-This video marks &quot;the last time&quot; Paris Hilton &quot;will ever drink and text.&quot;</I></P><P></P><P><I>-Dudes who splurge for bottle service are not necessarily worth your time. They are, however, worth a verse in a Paris Hilton pop song.</I></P><P></P><P>In other music-related Hilton trivia you can't necessarily learn from watching her &quot;Drunk Text&quot; video, the 31-year-old is reportedly working on a full album's worth of material. As she told <I>E! News</I> on the Grammy red carpet, the record will embrace the electronic sounds that are so &quot;hot&quot; these days. </P><P></P><P>&quot;Right now, dance and house music is really in,&quot; Hilton said. &quot;That's what the album is.&quot; She also revealed that she's working with rapper Flo Rida on a track, Afrojack (Pitbull, David Guetta) is executive producing the disc, and LMFAO are also expected to appear. (Or maybe it's actually an up-and-coming duo called <B>&quot;</B><A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xybU-31IKIc&feature=player_embedded" TARGET="_blank"><B>LMAFO</B></A>.<B>&quot;</B> Hilton was a little confused about the details while talking to <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xybU-31IKIc&feature=player_embedded" TARGET="_blank">E!</A>.)</P><P></P><P>Afrojack, however, confirmed the news to <I>Billboard</I> -- though he wouldn't reveal much about what to expect. &quot;I'm going to let the music speak for itself.&quot;</P><P></P><P>So long as it doesn't text while drunk.</P><P></P><img style="visibility:hidden;width:0px;height:0px;" border=0 width=0 height=0 src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMzAyMTcyNTE3MTMmcHQ9MTMzMDIxNzI1NDc3NiZwPTEwNjM2NjImZD*mZz*yJm89NGQ1YjVjNjM1NjgwNDE1MTgz/NGIwZDRkZTkzOTI*ZWImb2Y9MA==.gif" /><object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="450" data="http://vids.perezhilton.com/plugins/player.swf?v=60775e13caaf2&p=vega4-without-ads-transparent-flp&autoplay=false" height="338" id="embedded_player"><param name="movie" value="http://vids.perezhilton.com/plugins/player.swf?v=60775e13caaf2&p=vega4-without-ads-transparent-flp&autoplay=false"/><param name="bgcolor" value="#000000"/><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true"/><param name="base" value="http://vids.perezhilton.com"/><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"/></object><BR><BR><a href="http://pinterest.com/dosedotca/"><img src="http://passets-cdn.pinterest.com/images/pinterest-button.png" width="78" height="26" alt="Follow Me on Pinterest" /></a>]]></content:encoded>

So how does Hollywood's foremost baker of &quot;chocolate pie&quot; celebrate this career-changing occasion?</P><P></P><P>&quot;I am going to get my boobs lifted,&quot; the 39-year-old actress told <A HREF="http://www.parade.com/celebrity/celebrity-parade/2012/02/22-octavia-spencer.html" TARGET="_blank"><I>Parade</I></A> magazine. &quot;That's going to be my first gift.

The Oscar nominee’s 2012 work schedule is keeping her busy until the late fall, it seems. &quot;Right after the Oscars I start a Diablo Cody movie,&quot; she told <I>Parade,</I> apparently referring to the <I>Juno</I>-screenwriter's as-yet-untitled directorial debut. &quot;We're taping out of the country for four months, so I wouldn't be back here until about August. So, I would want to do this around November. Then that way I could just relax until January.&quot;</P><P></P><P>And with that, you now know more about a Hollywood star's medical plans than you ever should. </P><P></P><P>The 84th annual Academy Awards air Sunday, Feb. 26.

Biebz is a huge fan of <A HREF="http://www.dose.ca/music/Curiosity+Didn+Kill+Carly+Jepsen/6171341/story.html" TARGET="_blank"><B>Carly Rae Jespen</B></A>'s hit, &quot;Call Me Maybe.&quot; After Bieber Tweeted about how much he loves the frothy pop track (currently the No. 3 song on Canadian iTunes), the pop star's manager, Scooter Braun, signed the Vancouver singer-songwriter to his label, Schoolboy Records. And he's done this 26-year-old <I>Canadian Idol</I> alum one further solid -- recording a new music video for &quot;Call Me Maybe.&quot; </P><P></P><P>Apparently shot on somebody's webcam, the production quality might leave something to be desired -- especially compared to Jepsen's cutesy <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4N9WiVACqQ&ob=av2e" TARGET="_blank"><B>original</B></A>. But then, this is 2012. Just adding Bieber makes for instant cinematic magic. That the DIY clip also happens to feature Selena Gomez, <I>High School Musical</I>'s Ashley Tisdale -- and members of Boys Like Girls and Big Time Rush is just tween-baiting gravy. (Random thought: real gravy is probably not an effective way of baiting tweens. Unless it's been thrown on Justin Bieber.)</P><P></P><P>We've posted the video below -- which was uploaded to YouTube by Big Time Rush's Carlos Pena (look for him in the video. He's one of about a half-dozen teen stars lip syncing to the track), before being tweeted by Bieber.</P><P></P><P>Jepsen's EP,<I> Curiosity</I>, arrived Feb. 14, with a full album reportedly expected within the year. And according to the Juno nominee's <A HREF="https://twitter.com/#!/carlyraejepsen/status/172203380276609024" TARGET="_blank">Twitter</A>, Jepsen was working with Bieber and others in L.A. this week. As she wrote yesterday, &quot;In the studio with @justinbieber. Listening to his new stuff and it's blowing my mind.&quot;</P><P></P><P>Watch Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez's &quot;Call Me Maybe&quot; lip dub below.</P><iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/AsBsBU3vn6M" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><P></P><P>(For more, check out our <A HREF="http://www.dose.ca/music/Curiosity+Didn+Kill+Carly+Jepsen/6171341/story.html" TARGET="_blank">interview with Carly Rae Jepsen</A>.)</P><P></P><P><A HREF="mailto:leahc@dose.ca" TARGET="_blank">leahc@dose.ca</A></P><P></P><P></P>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P><I>Private Practice</I> star Kate Walsh is showing off her impossibly McDreamy body on the cover of the March issue of <A HREF="http://www.shape.com/blogs/fit-famous/kate-walsh-bares-all-cover-shape" TARGET="_blank"><I>Shape</I></A> magazine, appearing in only her birthday suit, some well-placed shadows the only things hiding her private parts. </P><P></P><P>“I was terrified, but I really wanted to do a naked cover -- especially with <I>Shape</I> because the magazine is about loving yourself inside and out,” the 44-year-old tells the mag, which is due in stores next Monday. “Right now, I feel really healthy, confident, and sexy. I'm enjoying my 40s and wanted to share that.”</P><P></P><P>So how does the Hollywood actress keep her “healthy, confident” look? </P><P></P><P>According to Walsh, it’s (mostly) natural. </P><P></P><P>“We live in a strange time when getting plastic surgery is as common as dyeing your hair,” the TV star explains. (By the way, she also admitted to dyeing her hair.) “But in my profession, I need a malleable face. Everyone has her line in the sand. I draw mine at facials and laser treatments.” </P><P></P><P>But why call the doctor, when you can have <I>Shape</I>’s art department make the same touch ups? (Walsh’s cover appears to have had more than a little “treatment.”) </P><P></P><P>Still, Walsh was quick to add she doesn’t judge others who’ve indulged in cosmetic procedures: “If others want to go a step further, it’s their call.”</P><P></P><P></P><P><A HREF="mailto:jond@dose.ca" TARGET="_blank">jond@dose.ca</A></P>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>From funeral programs for sale to auctions of clothes worn in <I>The Bodyguard</I>, it looks like everyone is trying to cash in on the late Whitney Houston. </P><P></P><P>One person on that list may the singer's ex-husband Bobby Brown, according to reports. Brown is shopping a tell-all book that he previously wrote, reports the<A HREF="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/21/bobby-brown-whitney-houston-tell-all-book_n_1291434.html" TARGET="_blank"><B><I> Huffington Post</I></B></A>. &quot;Back in 2008, the interest in a book on Whitney Houston wasn't that great,&quot; a major publisher told the site. &quot;Whitney had fallen off the radar back then ... but now, following her tragic death, the market has changed. Now is the time for a book that details an honest look into the life of Whitney.&quot;</P><P></P><P>But getting that book published isn't as easy as it sounds. According to the site, Brown is tangled in a web of legal woes due to the fact that he signed a confidentiality agreement when he and Houston settled their divorce. </P><P></P><P>A tell-all could also negativley impact his daughter, Bobbi Kristina Brown. &quot;Bobby loves all his children,&quot; his former attorney, Phaedra Parks, told the <I>Huffington Post </I>days after Houston passed. &quot;He would do anything to protect all his children.&quot;</P><P></P><P>Sources close to the late singer say that they wouldn't doubt it if he was shopping around for quick money fix. An insider told the site, &quot;This is a man who left his ex-wife's funeral because he didn't like his seats and went to a paying gig that night. He didn't get on stage that night because he needed to sing his greatest hits or because Whitney would have wanted him to entertain his fans, he did it to get a paycheck -- the same reason he now wants to write a tell-all book.&quot;</P><P></P><P>A tell-all book may be the last thing that Bobbi Kristina needs right now. </P><P></P><P><A HREF="http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/bobbi-kristina-browns-problems-are-out-of-control-2012222" TARGET="_blank"><B><I>Us Weekly</I></B></A> reports loved ones are concerned Houston’s only daughter may be heading down the same path as her troubled parents and are urging her to go to rehab. The source told the site, &quot;Whitney's passing is sending Bobbi off the deep end,&quot; adding that the Houston family is &quot;shocked&quot; by the range of her issues. </P><P></P><P>&quot;Bobbi's problems are out of control,&quot; the insider revealed to <I>Us Weekly</I>.</P>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P><A HREF="http://www.dose.ca/music/6190894/story.html" TARGET="_blank"><B>Rihanna and Chris Brown</B></A> have inspired many of us to Tweet, debate and -- above all -- barf these last few weeks. (OK, these last few years, really.) Even WWE champions have not been immune, and like many before him, pro wrestler CM Punk shared his opinion of Chris Brown Feb. 20, <A HREF="https://twitter.com/#!/CMPunk/status/171472880419344384" TARGET="_blank">Tweeting</A> he'd like to see the pop star &quot;fight somebody that can defend themselves. Me curb stomping that turd would be a #wrestlemania moment.&quot;</P><P></P><P>Here's where the members of Team Breezy get totes jealous, though: Brown responded, with that inimitable vitriol the more disturbed members of his fanbase find so dreamy.</P><P></P><P>&quot;@CMpunk needs more followers. He's such a leader! Not to mention the roids hes on has made it utterly impossible for him pleasure a women,&quot; Brown Tweeted at one point during his spaz.</P><P></P><P>&quot;@CMpunk contact my assistant and I'll have em send u an autographed pic for my biggest FAN! (sic).&quot;</P><P></P><P>No word on the status of that order, but Punk followed up with Brown -- and his nearly 700,000 Twitter followers -- posting a video message with the caption &quot;This must be said.&quot;</P><P></P><P>Punk, real name Phil Brooks, is heading into a WWE Championship fight in the coming months, but in the video, the wrestler states that his Tweet wasn't a bid for &quot;publicity.&quot; Still, he stands by his challenge, and if Brown's game, he'd like the match to benefit a women's shelter of his choosing.</P><P></P><P>The video's below, but here's what Punk had to say:</P><P></P><P>&quot;I'm a lifelong, proud, drug-free straight edge individual so Chris and I come from two completely different worlds,&quot; said Punk, addressing Brown's crack about steroid use. </P><P></P><P>&quot;I don't have a manager, I don't have a bodyguard, I don't have an assistant, I have no need for a PR team what to tweet or when to delete tweets and I don't hit women. Period,” Punk continued, addressing the 2009 incident wherein Brown repeatedly beat Rihanna until she was left bleeding and unconscious. </P><P></P><P>“In my world women are to be revered and respected and I firmly believe that in this life there are consequences and repercussions for people's actions and I don't think Chris has paid for what he's done. Picking up trash on the side of a highway does not make a mends for repeatedly striking a woman in her face and sending her to hospital.&quot;</P><P></P><P>Brown, who was convicted of assault in 2009, was sentenced to five years of supervised probation and six months of community service, which he continues to complete.</P><P></P><P>Punk continued: &quot;So if Chris wants to throw stones my way now I say that's fine let's put some gloves out and get in the ring and I will choke you out and I will make you feel as weak and as powerless and scared and alone as any woman who has had the misfortune of knowing a sad, cowardly, little boy such as yourself and all proceeds can go to a women's shelter of my choosing ... Chris Brown isn't a man and that's fine. I just know that someday, somewhere somehow, somebody will put Chris Brown exactly where he belongs and that obviously doesn't have to be me. I would just really like it to be.&quot; </P><P></P><P>Brown has since responded to Punk -- though he hasn't said anything about whether he'll take up the challenge.</P><P></P><P>Further violence, even if MC’d by a member of the McMahon family, wouldn’t solve anything, anyway. Has Brown suddenly matured? Has he found inner peace and enlightenment and the spell-check function on his phone? Let’s check out what he Tweeted:</P><P></P><P>&quot;the video u just posted was cute! It's so funny how defensive u are.</P><P></P><P>&quot;And the fact that I really don't know who you are and could give a shit is the funny part!</P><P></P><P>&quot;I miss the real wrestlers! ( Hacksaw Jim duggan, Brett the hitman heart, coco beware, rowdy roddy piper) #Notnopunks (sic).&quot;</P><P></P><P>So Brown doesn't know a CM Punk from an Ultimate Warrior. Perhaps he's familiar with these celebs? Stars ranging from Miranda Lambert to <I>Modern Family</I>'s Eric Stonestreet have been calling out Brown since his Grammy performance last week. (For more, check out this round-up of stars' <A HREF="http://www.dose.ca/Update+Unapologetic+Chris+Brown+Tells+Haters/6150930/story.html" TARGET="_blank"><B>reactions to Brown's Grammy appearance</B></A>.)</P><iframe src="http://www.twitvid.com/embed.php?guid=4CAPE&amp;autoplay=0" title="Twitvid video player " class="twitvid-player" type="text/html" width="480" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe><P></P><P><A HREF="mailto:leahc@dose.ca" TARGET="_blank">leahc@dose.ca</A></P>]]></content:encoded>

As for the people next door, they're also played by duo's RedFoo and Sky Blu (in performances that owe much to the grand comedic tradition of <I>White Chicks</I> and <I>Big Momma's House</I>), and when old man RedFoo has enough with all the after-hours &quot;Wiggling&quot; and &quot;Shuffling&quot; going on, he calls the cops on the party. Further Wiggling and Shuffling -- and product spots for assorted LMFAO-related goods -- ensues.</P><P></P><P>The video is directed by Mickey Finnegan, who also took charge of LMFAO's past videos, &quot;Party Rock Anthem,&quot; &quot;Champagne Showers&quot; and &quot;Sexy and I Know It,&quot; works of epic nonsense, every one. </P><P></P><P>&quot;We treat our music videos like movies,&quot; LMFAO's RedFoo told Dose.ca in December, saying that he and Sky Blu are hoping to get into making actual movies sooner than later. &quot;Me and Sky have always been interested in acting and doing skits ...and Improv Olympics, I went to Improv Olympics and graduated from there, used to do stand-up comedy, been in a few independent films so it’s fun to, you know, play characters and just entertain people.&quot;</P><P></P><P>Watch &quot;Sorry For Party Rocking&quot; below:</P><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/SkTt9k4Y-a8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><P></P><P><A HREF="mailto:leahc@dose.ca" TARGET="_blank">leahc@dose.ca</A></P>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>Lest you think he's just a set of pretty abs, Zac Efron told the <A HREF="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/gossip/2012/02/the-lorax-taylor-swift-zac-efron.html" TARGET="_blank"><I>L.A. Times</I></A> that he's been taking guitar lessons from his <I>Lorax</I> costar, Taylor Swift. &quot;She's a great teacher,&quot; Efron said from the movie's &quot;orange&quot; carpet. And for proof, we're looking to Efron and Swift's recent visit to the <I>Ellen DeGeneres Show</I>. The costars played their own version of Foster the People's &quot;Pumped Up Kicks&quot; during their interview, and while we won't comment on whether Efron's guitar chops are righteous enough to inspire some Wildcat Pride, he's definitely picked up on one of Swift's most bankable skills: cuteness.</P><P></P><P>While DeGeneres cracked wise about whether Swift and Efron's relationship status, the duo freestyled their own lyrics. We're partial to Swift's verse, a little nod to her past visits to the program.</P><P></P><P>&quot;She always asks me who I'm dating everytime I'm on this show/ and I don't even know why/ But it gets five million hits on YouTube!&quot;</P><P></P><P>She knows us so well. As such, please watch Swift and Efron's duet below. Every view brings us one step closer to five million hits:</P><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/d8kCTPPwfpM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><P></P><P></P><P></P><P><A HREF="mailto:leahc@dose.ca" TARGET="_blank">leahc@dose.ca</A></P><P></P><P></P>]]></content:encoded>
