Consistently on the precipice of being voted out of his Savaii tribe, Cochran managed to make it to the merge before switching allegiances and ensuring his survival while the rest of his former Savaii tribe was picked off one at a time by the remaining Upolu members. Ultimately, Cochran's downfall was his belief that his new cohorts would treat him as an equal and appreciate his turncoat tactic. Instead, he became the last former Savaii member to be eliminated. Now, he tells Dose.ca about his fan-boy strategy, his relationship with the rest of his former tribe and whether he regrets the big move that doomed his tribe and, ultimately, himself.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Now that you've seen the consequences of your actions, do you regret switching allegiances?  &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I'm fine with the switch itself, I'm not happy with how I played after switching. I got complacent and didn't really do enough to make sure that the people on the bottom of the other tribe's totem pole were willing to work with me. There's stuff I could have done before like demanding that I be given the immunity idol instead of ever being in danger of pulling a rock but flipping was going to happen at one point or another. Maybe I was premature and maybe I didn't follow up well enough. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;You established early on that you were a fan of the show and an intellectual who understood its tactics. Did you arrive on the island knowing you were going to make a big move at some point?&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;No because, looking back at previous winners, an under the radar strategy – where you charm people and make them want to give you the money – that's a pretty effective strategy. But it became apparent as I was there that that wasn't going to work for me. Apparently I was not charming people enough. I was not enough of an under the radar personality that I knew I had to do something. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It's possible that if I'd stuck with my own tribe they would have brought me to the end but I wouldn't have won. They would have brought me as someone who's bad at challenges and annoys people. So I knew I had to do something to make a coherent final tribunal argument. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Several of the other former Savaii members we've interviewed said they would have given you the idol if you'd asked for it. If you had been offered, would you have taken it instead of switching sides? &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;At the time, I don't know. But now if I could go back in time and take the idol I would say yes. I would take it and I wouldn't flip until at least a couple of tribal councils later when we would have whittled down a few Upolu people, maybe grab Dawn and we would have taken out Savaii. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;In terms of understand the game and its strategies, how different was being there than watching the show on TV?&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It's drastically different. I know the game extraordinarily well but my knowledge didn't do anything other than preventing me from making a few cardinal errors in terms of bossing people around. It was shocking that I felt kind of powerless almost right from the beginning. I envisioned at least some point having a conversation with somebody saying, &amp;quot;Tonight, so-and-so goes home.&amp;quot; But I never had that conversation, the only conversations I had were, &amp;quot;It's not going to be me going home, right?&amp;quot; So it wasn't what I dreamt of when I fantasized about playing &lt;I&gt;Survivor&lt;/I&gt;. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;What was your goal in appearing feeble and self-deprecating?&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I actually wanted to be underestimated. I could come into the game with one of two types of personalities: the nerdy Harvard guy who knows the game extraordinarily well and is a threat or I could be this pathetic self-deprecating guy whose kind of a joke and isn't threating. So, given those two options, I went with what I thought would take me farthest in the game. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;How does it feel being portrayed as a villain?&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I think that most people dislike me, even in my real life (&lt;I&gt;laughs&lt;/I&gt;), but I don't think I necessarily get called a villain. I get 'weasel,' 'cockroach,' 'coward'; those are words that you generally use to describe a villain. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Jim told us that he would never respect you. How does that make you feel?&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;First off, I'm on good terms with Jim. Part of me feels like he's just posturing himself to be this larger than life personality and maybe create some feud that doesn't exist. I don't mean to shatter that for Jim because I like the guy. The fact that he said he has no respect for me, whatever. The people whose opinions matter to me they seem to respect me and whether Jim does or not I guess it's irrelevant though I would like to have a friendship with him. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</div></content><rights type="text">Copyright (c) dose.ca</rights><source><title type="html">Survivor Interview: John Cochran</title><subtitle type="html">Harvard law student John Cochran tells Dose.ca about his fan-boy strategy, his relationship with the rest of his former tribe and whether he regrets the big move that doomed his tribe and, ultimately, himself.</subtitle><id>tag:www.dose.ca:content=5860599</id><rights type="html">Copyright (c) dose.ca</rights><updated>2011-12-14T21:24:34Z</updated><category term="Surviror" label="ConTopic" /><category term="Dose.ca" label="Distributor" /><category term="STRY" label="ContentTypeCode" /><category term="DOSE" label="Catalog" /><category term="Y" label="Comments" /><category term="UTF8" label="Format" /><category relevance="23" term="Dose.ca" label="Company" /><category relevance="86" term="Cochran , John" label="Individual" /><category relevance="100" term="0~John Cochran~Harvard University~Dose.ca" label="InformQString" /><category relevance="46" term="Harvard University" label="Organization" /><category relevance="86" term="John Cochran" label="Person" /><generator>(c) Postmedia Network Inc.</generator><link href="http://www.dose.ca/5860599.ATOM" rel="alternate" type="application/atom+xml" title="Survivor Interview: John Cochran" /><link href="http://www.dose.ca/5860599.ATOM" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" title="Survivor Interview: John Cochran" /></source></entry><entry Status="FREE"><id>tag:www.dose.ca:content=5860604</id><title type="html">Survivor Interview: John Cochran</title><summary type="html"></summary><published>2011-12-14T00:00:00Z</published><updated>2011-12-14T20:07:08Z</updated><author><name>CBS</name></author><link href="5860604.bin" Abstract="Harvard law student John Cochran" Credit="CBS" rel="alternate" type="image/jpeg" title="[ more ]" /><link href="Survivor+Interview+John+Cochran/5860599/story.html?tab=PHOT" Abstract="Harvard law student John Cochran tells Dose.ca about his fan-boy strategy, his relationship with the rest of his former tribe and whether he regrets the big move that doomed his tribe and, ultimately, himself."
