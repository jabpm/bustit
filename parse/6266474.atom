His need to make everything a competition and refusal to play nice with the rival Salani tribe didn't win him many allies, but it was rival and anti-jock Colton who untimely led to Quinlan becoming the first casualty of the manly Manono tribe. Talking to Dose.ca, the 33-year-old attorney claims he's not as militant in real life as the show made him seem, and that &amp;quot;diva&amp;quot; Colton was the real alpha male of the cast.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;You came across as a brutish, alpha male on the show. Do you feel that was an accurate portrayal of your time on Survivor?&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The environment definitely brought out that side came out of me but there were also a lot of fun-loving and humble moments; it wasn't all militant and brash. But I get it, it's TV and you can't show me 24 hours a day. All in all, I'm taking it with a grain of salt. I just want the viewers to recognize that there's a lot more to me then they saw. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;In your opinion, who or what was responsible for triggering your competitive behaviour?&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It's the ultimate competition and if I were competing on a grand scale for a huge reward, whether it was in Survivor or any other game, I would get serious and competitive, and that's what I did. That's why the cutthroat business side of me came out. Of course, we were also sleep deprived and we were eating 500 calories a day. We're just completely depleted so obviously it's not as easy to be as friendly and nice as you'd like to be. It's a recipe for drama and that's what you got. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Did you get a sense you would be the first male voted off?&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I wasn't blindsided. From day one, Lief told me that I was being targeted by some of the guys to be the first one out, so that was obviously disappointing and I knew from the very first day that, because of the men-versus-women format, they were starting to play the game like it was an individual game even though it was a team game so my atheletesism and strength, which might normally protect me in a team game, were disregarded or at least minimized. So I did feel very vulnerable and tried to fight against the numbers the entire week but ultimately lost out. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;If you had the chance, what would you have done differently?&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;One thing that immediately comes to mind is the way that I was working with Colton. I didn't appreciate Colton for what he was until it was too late. He got out there and was very emotional and whiny and wasn't very likeable for the first few days. Then once he got that hidden immunity idol he really transformed himself into a diva of sorts. He became very cocky and very power hungry; he wanted people to woo him. He really is an alpha male and people don't see that in him, but that's what he is. He wants to control things and he wants to be in charge and he wants it to be about him. Colton really was the monkey wrench in tribe, if you will. The one important cog you needed to have control of in order to be able to advance and ultimately I didn't evaluate him quickly enough. By the time I did, it was too late for me. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Unlike Colton, you seemed to go out of your way to exclude the female tribe.  Do you regret that?&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I still think [my strategy] makes sense. We're competing for a million dollars, they're the other team and it doesn't make sense to make their lives easier so they can be better and compete better. I mean, we're all dealing with deprivation out there and it just doesn't make sense to bring in your enemy and say, â€˜Why don't you come warm up by my fire? Let me get you out of the rain, let me feed you so you can compete better and beat me in the next challenge.' I think it was tough to put aside your real world sentiments about chivalry and kindness and generally being a nice guy and trying to take care of them like we all would in real life, but I guess I was the most readily willing to adopt that approach. Ultimately I think everyone came around, but that being said, we were all working with the girls and, despite what you saw on TV, I had a good relationship with most of the women and was trying to work together with them in anticipation of a merge. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Do you think you would have been able to stay in the game longer if there was Redemption Island this season?&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Definitely. I think Redemption Island plays to my strengths and I feel that people would have been less willing to vote me out if they knew I was going to Redemption Island and was going to come back. &lt;/P&gt;</div></content><rights type="text">Copyright (c) dose.ca</rights><source><title type="html">Interview: Survivor: One World's Matt Quinlan</title><subtitle type="html">Talking to Dose.ca, the 33-year-old attorney claims he's not as militant in real life as the show made him seem, and that "diva" Colton was the real alpha male of the cast.</subtitle><id>tag:www.dose.ca:content=6266474</id><rights type="html">Copyright (c) dose.ca</rights><updated>2012-03-07T22:03:27Z</updated><category term="Survivor" label="ConTopic" /><category term="Dose.ca" label="Distributor" /><category term="STRY" label="ContentTypeCode" /><category term="DOSE" label="Catalog" /><category term="Y" label="Comments" /><category term="UTF8" label="Format" /><category relevance="100" term="Colton" label="City" /><category relevance="28" term="Dose.ca" label="Company" /><category relevance="63" term="Quinlan , Matt" label="Individual" /><category relevance="100" term="3089~Colton~Survivor (TV Show)~Matt Quinlan~Dose.ca" label="InformQString" /><category relevance="100" term="Survivor (TV Show)" label="Misc" /><category relevance="63" term="Matt Quinlan" label="Person" /><category relevance="33" term="Arts, Entertainment, and Media" label="Topic" /><category relevance="33" term="Entertainment" label="Topic" /><category relevance="33" term="Media" label="Topic" /><category relevance="33" term="Reality Competition Shows" label="Topic" /><category relevance="33" term="Reality Shows" label="Topic" /><category relevance="33" term="Television" label="Topic" /><generator>(c) Postmedia Network Inc.</generator><link href="http://www.dose.ca/6266474.ATOM" rel="alternate" type="application/atom+xml" title="Interview: Survivor: One World's Matt Quinlan" /><link href="http://www.dose.ca/6266474.ATOM" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" title="Interview: Survivor: One World's Matt Quinlan" /></source></entry><entry Status="FREE"><id>tag:www.dose.ca:content=6266479</id><title type="html">Survivor: One World's Matt Quinlan</title><summary type="html"></summary><published>2012-03-07T00:00:00Z</published><updated>2012-03-07T22:03:30Z</updated><author><name>CBS</name></author><link href="6266479.bin" Abstract="Survivor: One World's Matt Quinlan claims he's not as militant in real life as the show made him seem."
