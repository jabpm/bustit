This gives the game a very nostalgic feel. In many ways, it's very similar to some of the first titles in the franchise. At times the game is extremely difficult, ammo is scarce and enemies (called Ooze) are abundant, but then other missions are a breeze to complete. This makes the overall difficulty level somewhat unbalanced.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Resident Evil Revelations is amazing looking and it truly proves what the 3DS  is capable of creating graphically. It adopts a third person perspective that features, beautiful lighting effects and environments filled with intricate details. Its eerie soundtrack is equally impressive and features the best sound effects and appropriately atmospheric music I've ever heard in a handheld title.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The best parts of the game takes place on an appropriately spooky derelict ship dubbed the Queen Zenobia. The game's other environments, snow filled European mountains and dark bunkers, aren't as fun or atmospheric.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Unfortunately, Resident Evil Revelations is also hindered by occasional annoying graphical glitches. Gameplay slows to a crawl when there are multiple enemies on the screen (strangely the game also lags during its frequent load screens) and with 3D enabled, the 3DS' screen sometimes flickers. These are minor annoyances that don't happen frequently and can be easily overlooked but are still bothersome.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Resident Evil Revelations also features a convoluted ridiculous plot line, a staple of the Resident Evil franchise. This time though, the tale of a terrorist organization called Veltro, biological weapons (hilariously called B.O.Ws in the game) and government conspiracies, seems downright ridiculous, even by Resident Evil's standards. There's also an Alan Wake-like episodic recap before each level that recounts the the game's events. It doesn't help much though. The story still makes very little sense and becomes increasingly confusing as the game progresses&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The story bounces all over the place, focusing on different aspects of the game's mission through the perspectives of various characters. The portions of the story where you control Resident Evil Revelations' lead characters, Jill and Parker, come across slightly better than the rest of the game.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Gameplay wise, Resident Evil Revelations is hit or miss. The game's unbalanced difficulty level makes it at times extremely frustrating. While the game attempts to straddle the line between survival horror and survival action, at times, it feels like it doesn't exactly know what kind of title it wants to be. The controls are competent but they have the potential to be very frustrating, especially during boss fights.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Like most Resident Evil titles, your character controls like an awkward tank, turning is difficult and you can't shoot while moving. These are mainstays of the franchise and are supposed to add to the feeling of tension the Resident Evil series is trying to convey to the player. Sometimes this strange control method works, but I constantly found myself wishing I could shoot while moving.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The game's entire control mechanic makes the title seem somewhat dated. It's also difficult to control the game with only one joystick. Although I didn't get a chance to play the game with the 3Ds' circle pad pro accessory, I have heard that it solves many Resident Evil Revelations' control issues.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The game adopts a first person perspective when shooting and this really shows off its 3D effect. For the most part though, I played the game with the 3DS' 3D feature disabled. It just really doesn't add much to the game's overall experience.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The game is divided into relatively bite sized chapters to help gamers who are playing it on the go. Backtracking through past levels is frequent in Resident Evil Revelations and constantly seeing the same environments over and over again, starts to get really boring.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Its auto save feature also can potentially cause difficulties for the player (you can turn auto save off though). If the game just auto saved and you're low on health and about to fight a large group of enemies or a boss, you're essentially screwed. Reverting to a previous save file brings you back a few short seconds and then you have to hunt down extra health (if there even is any available), or die at the hand of Resident Evil Revelation's various enemies.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The game also features a multiplayer portion dubbed raid mode, that allows two players to fight through an onslaught of enemies in order to reach a predetermined point.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the end, Resident Evil Revelations offers a solid experience, one that rivals that of full-fledged console games in the franchise. If you're able to overlook the game's many glaring flaws, underneath you'll find a relatively solid survival horror experience.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;Follow Patrick O'Rourke on Twitter @&lt;/I&gt;&lt;A HREF="http://www.twitter.com/Patrick_ORourke" TARGET="_blank"&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;Patrick_ORourke&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;I&gt; and check out his opinions-based gaming site @&lt;/I&gt;&lt;A HREF="https://twitter.com/#%21/gamejudgment" TARGET="_blank"&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;GameJudgment&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/A5QTLtLr844" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</div></content><rights type="text">Copyright (c) dose.ca</rights><source><title type="html">Review: Resident Evil Revelations</title><subtitle type="html">Graphically, it's the best looking game on the Nintendo 3DS and its cinematic quality rivals console Resident Evil titles, but the game's somewhat wonky control scheme and rampant glitches threaten to ruin the title.</subtitle><id>tag:www.dose.ca:content=6271142</id><rights type="html">Copyright (c) dose.ca</rights><updated>2012-03-08T17:02:54Z</updated><category term="Resident Evil Revelations" label="ConTopic" /><category term="GameJudgment" label="Distributor" /><category term="STRY" label="ContentTypeCode" /><category term="DOSE" label="Catalog" /><category term="Y" label="Comments" /><category term="UTF8" label="Format" /><category relevance="6" term="Twitter Inc." label="Company" /><category relevance="23" term="O'Rourke , Patrick" label="Individual" /><category relevance="100" term="317~Nintendo 3DS~Resident Evil~Patrick O'Rourke~Alan Wake" label="InformQString" /><category relevance="23" term="Patrick O'Rourke" label="Person" /><category relevance="15" term="Alan Wake" label="Product" /><category relevance="100" term="Nintendo 3DS" label="Product" /><category relevance="100" term="Resident Evil" label="Product" /><category relevance="74" term="Culture and Lifestyle" label="Topic" /><category relevance="74" term="Games" label="Topic" /><category relevance="74" term="Hobbies and Pastimes" label="Topic" /><category relevance="74" term="Video Games" label="Topic" /><generator>(c) Postmedia Network Inc.</generator><link href="http://www.dose.ca/6271142.ATOM" rel="alternate" type="application/atom+xml" title="Review: Resident Evil Revelations" /><link href="http://www.dose.ca/6271142.ATOM" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" title="Review: Resident Evil Revelations" /></source></entry><entry Status="FREE"><id>tag:www.dose.ca:content=6271154</id><title type="html">Resident Evil Revelations</title><summary type="html"></summary><published>2012-03-08T00:00:00Z</published><updated>2012-03-08T17:02:57Z</updated><author><name>handout</name></author><link href="6271154.bin" Abstract="Resident Evil Revelations" Credit="handout" rel="alternate" type="image/jpeg" title="[ more ]" /><link href="Review+Resident+Evil+Revelations/6271142/story.html?tab=PHOT" Abstract="Graphically, it's the best looking game on the Nintendo 3DS and its cinematic quality rivals console Resident Evil titles, but the game's somewhat wonky control scheme and rampant glitches threaten to ruin the title."
